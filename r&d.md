## [ ] Arrays: GC vs memory

  0. GC

## [ ] Closures: how?

  0. Set of vars
    - overhead per-function call

  1. Struct create per fn call
    - relative overhead of setting current struct
    ? is there a way to set array only if it's changed?

  1.1 `if (curStruct != newStruct) { prevStruct = curStruct; curStruct = newStruct; } ... if (prevStruct) curStruct = prevStruct`
    + only 2 condition checks overhead
    + can be handled on polyfill level
