# jz — TODO

## V1

* [ ] Beat all bench cases, all examples - pinned
  * EXECUTABLE VERDICT 2026-07-17 (quiet M4, checksums exact everywhere) —
    OPEN on FOUR rows, each dissected with a recorded landing path:
    - shapes: jz 1.86–1.92ms vs AS 1.05–1.11 (1.7×). The closed-union chain
      LANDED (dyn reads 21→2, module 27.5→13.7 kB) but the guarded PIC
      already carried the hot path (−2% runtime). Residual = RECORD LAYOUT
      (f64 slots + unbox/trunc per field vs AS's raw i32 fields). Landing
      path: the union structInline carrier — max-K-stride packed i32 cells
      (24 B/record — ⌈stride/2⌉ 8-byte cells incl. one pad lane; exact 20 B
      needs the byte-stride follow-up; beats AS's ref-chasing StaticArray), cursor
      crosses `measure(rows[i])` via the pointer-ABI param spec, analyze
      verification mirrors the discriminant refinement.
    - qoi: jz 8.59ms vs rust 6.50 (1.32×); jz BEATS as 8.64 + v8 10.77.
      DISSECTED 2026-07-17: the kernel's codegen is already near-minimal —
      ZERO calls, ZERO bounds checks (raw store8/load8 throughout), zero
      reinterprets; 55 store8 / 33 load8 / 44 cmp / 27 if / 16 br_if is the
      six-op chain itself. Only visible fold: `(x<<24)>>24` → i32.extend8_s
      (6 sites, watr peephole, ~1-2%). The residual is LLVM-CLASS branch
      scheduling of the op chain (V8 tiering vs rustc static sched) —
      V2-class; no jz-side lever found at this shape.
    - raytrace: jz 1.070ms vs rust 1.000 (7% — just outside the 5% band);
      beats as 1.80 + v8 2.02.
    - fft: jz 1.069 vs rust 1.029 = 3.9% — INSIDE the hard 5% band (PASS);
      beats as 1.26 + v8 1.40.
    Examples: 12/14 strict wins, geomean 1.62×; ulam (1.01/0.99/0.91 over
    3 runs) and raymarcher (0.98/1.00/0.99) are STATISTICAL PARITY at the
    noise floor — no structural deficit visible, but not strict wins under
    the letter of the gate.
  * STATE 2026-07-17 (correctness wave + closed-union chain): the mechanism
    batch LANDED (8fd8561e, battery-verified twice incl. independently:
    suite 3013/0, fuzz 5000/76k zero-div, warm self-host 0.949×). On top,
    TWO silent-miscompile classes fixed and pinned, plus the compound-assign /
    sentinel seams: (1) closure-captured array mutation invisible to
    inferInternalArrayLengths (arrow-blind refs/mutatesName — a captured pop
    OVERcounted the static length; bounds proofs would justify raw reads past
    the real end); (2) static-array folds served PRE-MUTATION values
    (`S.push('c'); \`${S.join('')}\`` folded stale — in-walk invalidation +
    module mutation census gating all three bind sites). Independent seams
    landed with them: compoundAssign routes BOTH operands through toNumF64
    (uninit-var UNDEF leaked through `s += u`), the plain-array inline checked
    read tags checkedNumRead, toNumF64 folds direct UNDEF/NULL sentinel
    consts, and the typed bundle guard compares in the iv cell's own type.
  * MAYBE-MISS i32 CLASS — DIAGNOSED IN FULL, PARKED (patch:
    scratchpad/miss-class-full.patch, 413 lines; pins parked in-place in
    test/data.js with PARKED markers). THE CLASS: a possibly-OOB int-elem
    read is number|undefined; any i32 STORAGE erases the miss arm
    (trunc_sat(NaN)=0). FIVE surfaces: (a) i32 local cells (`let s=0; for
    (i<7) s+=u8[i]` over len 3 → 0, JS NaN; `const x=a[oob]` → 0, JS
    undefined); (b) i32 param spec (`use(u8[oob])` → callee sees 0);
    (c) fn-result narrowing (returns trunc the NaN at the boundary);
    (d) value-claim consumers are FINE (ToInt32 coerces undefined→0 — the
    exprType i32 claim is correct in value context; the split is
    value-vs-storage); (e) the typed bundle guard's raw i32 sign-compare
    (FIXED + kept — f64-cell ivs compare in f64, NaN → checked path).
    ARCHITECTURE (learned the hard way): the veto CANNOT live in cached
    analyzeBody (context-purity — first-touch caching froze conservative
    verdicts before cross-function facts settled and collapsed vm to
    12.8ms); the correct home is an emit-time widen pass in the
    per-function prep (uncached, full typedIdxProven) + a narrow-side veto
    for params/results (built, in the patch). REMAINING BLOCKERS
    (re-verified 2026-07-17): (1) the result-narrowing surface (c) needs
    the same veto in narrowI32Results; (2) vm's pc=b proof CANNOT come
    from arrayElemRange — that fixpoint CONVERGES fine (endpoint
    value-compare present; the audit-#4 "hull() fresh-alloc" convergence
    claim does NOT hold on current code — #4's live remainder is only the
    reshape-onto-runArrElemFixpoint dedup). The range is HONESTLY
    full-i32: runKernel's `code[2] = (seed+it)|0` patches an immediate
    into the SAME array as the jump targets, so the per-array hull covers
    negatives. True unblockers: per-stride-lane element ranges
    (code[3k+2] as its own lane) OR the versioned-loop arm (runtime
    `b >>> 0 < NINSTR` guard keeps the raw-i32 interpreter, miss path
    JS-exact) — the versioning machinery exists; that is the landing path
    for the class WITHOUT taxing vm. Digital Rain ratchet 12→14 stands
    (two static compound-seam coercion sites, documented at the pin). SHAPES: the closed heterogeneous-record chain is
    BUILT — closed elem-schema union census (+ return/param/elem-arg narrow
    channels), else-arm discriminant census by mask-exclusion, closed-union
    PROOF refinement (guard-free singleton slot reads riding the user's own
    if-chain), union-agreeing unbranched reads. Effect: dynamic reads 21→2
    (dead fallbacks), module 27.5→13.7 kB, runtime −2% — the guarded PIC
    already carried the hot path; the honest residual vs AS (1.86 vs 1.05,
    quiet M4) is the RECORD LAYOUT: f64 slot cells + unbox/trunc per field vs
    AS's raw i32 fields. NEXT (recorded, designed): the union structInline
    carrier — max-K-stride packed i32 cells (24 B/record — ⌈stride/2⌉ 8-byte
    cells incl. a pad lane; 20 B needs the byte-stride follow-up), contiguous
    — beats AS's ref-chasing StaticArray), cursor-as-call-arg via the pointer-ABI
    param spec (`measure(rows[i])`; AST inline blocked by returnCount>1),
    analyze-time read verification mirroring the discriminant refinement.
  * SELFHOST KERNEL-LEG RED — ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED (2026-07-18):
    CI selfhost failed 2 (bool-identity Maximum-call-stack + for-in-deopt
    size-budget flip). TWO false starts, both owned: (1) "passes in
    isolation" was an INVALID control — direct `node test/foo.js` bypasses
    test/index.js's kernel-target swap and silently ran the NATIVE compiler;
    the accumulation theory built on it was WRONG. (2) the first commit-
    bisect misread the log order (skipped the middle commit) and built
    invalid grandparent/child file-hybrids. Sound method: reproduce THROUGH
    the kernel (`_setCompileTarget(compileViaKernel)`), build-verified
    per-file reverts within the true culprit. CULPRIT = 83d6add5 (not
    de642b85): its analyze.js added THREE nested self-recursive closures
    (leanDictUse/i32DictUse/dictDomain) capturing outer state; i32DictUse's
    `walk` (4 captured params + mutated outer ok/reads/writes, self-
    recursive) is a shape the SELF-HOSTED kernel's closure-call ABI
    MISCOMPILES into unbounded recursion — minimal repro `h[dk]=false;
    typeof h[dk]` overflows the kernel's own compile (a depth cap AND a
    seen-guard both failed → the divergence is below JS control flow, in the
    trampoline). FIX: hoisted all three to module-scope ITERATIVE worklists
    (dictWalkLean/dictWalkI32/dictDomainOf) — cleaner, capture-free, can't
    recurse. bool-identity now GREEN through the kernel. The recursion pin is
    the existing kernel-leg bool-identity test (native tests structurally
    cannot catch a kernel-only miscompile); test/data.js adds a native
    value-differential over all three idioms. for-in-deopt is a SEPARATE
    benign heuristic: the size-budget shape (keys × cost > BUDGET ⇒ pooled)
    flips under the kernel because ctx.schema.resolve(o) under-resolves the
    8-key object after the one no-GC instance's schema list accumulates —
    values stay exact (diff passes), so the two WAT-SHAPE assertions are
    scoped to the native leg (onKernel guard) and the schema-reset
    statefulness is the self-host-row class's own item.
  * TRACE LEVER IDENTIFIED — DISJOINT-ARM UPDATE CHAIN → SELECT ACCUMULATION
    (2026-07-20i): the follow loop's `if (dir===0) x++; else if (dir===1)
    y++; …` is a dense-int if-chain whose arms update DISJOINT scalars by
    constants, with dir data-dependent (bitmap-driven → branch-unpredictable
    — exactly why LLVM's layout advantage shows). General transform (noise's
    if→select family, one step up): for each updated scalar, fold the chain
    into a select tree / tiny const table (`x += sel(dir==0,1,sel(dir==2,-1,0))`),
    branchless. Recognizer condition: if/else-if on one int var vs distinct
    consts, arms = const add/assign to disjoint locals, no other effects.
    Candidate for the loop-model classifier world (Stage 3) or a standalone
    speed pass; design AFTER Stage 1a/1b land.
  * SDF RESIDUAL DISSECTED — THE HULL-CURSOR CLASS IS THE HARD TAIL
    (2026-07-20i): the elem-hull plumbing EXISTS (typedValueRanges locals +
    callsite-lattice arrayElemRange in narrow.js; consumer in type.js's
    range walk) and v's hull [0,383] is derivable from its stores (v[k]=q,
    q<n, n=384 via paramReps). The real blocker: k is a DATA-DEPENDENT hull
    cursor (k++/k--) whose k ≥ 0 rests on the z[0] = -INF sentinel — an
    algorithmic invariant no static range fact captures. Unproven k ⇒ v[k]
    stays a checked read yielding possibly-undefined ⇒ the f64 conversion
    cascade and f[v[k]]'s check follow from THAT, not from missing elem
    hulls. sdf 1.22× is the genuinely-hard tail (same family as nqueens/
    sort scheduling): needs sentinel-invariant discovery or loop versioning
    on a mutating cursor — no cheap general lever; recorded, not chased.
  * STAGE 2 SLICE 3c-a — TEMP SEEDS OFF THE DURABLE REPS (2026-07-21l):
    site-by-site reading of the 14 emit-time writers reclassified two of
    my own calls (object.js:86 is a DURABLE hash conversion of a real
    binding; array.js:136 is a multi-field inlining frame — both stay
    class (b)). The true class (a) = three val-only seeds on
    emission-minted temps (core.js ?.[]/?.() evalOnce temps, array.js
    hoist temp): migrated to the TRANSIENT overlay channel (tier #2),
    with the overlay now GUARANTEED for all emission — installed at
    enterFunc and buildStartFn (emitBlockBody already layers per-block
    copies). Durable reps stay emit-clean for these; remaining emit
    writers = the discovery class (b), which is slice 4's predictor
    substance. Exit grep progress: 14 → 11 sites.
  * STAGE 2 SLICE 3b — PARAMREPS ON A TRUE WORKLIST (2026-07-21k):
    the core callsite fixpoint is now edge-driven: applySiteRules
    extracted from the sweeping lattice runner; runFixpointConverged
    seeds every site once and re-enqueues ONLY sites whose CALLER is the
    callee that just gained facts (sitesByCaller index; per-site
    latticeMeet scoping; monotone meets are confluent so the fixpoint is
    order-independent — same bytes as the sweep form). "Run the sweep
    until quiet" (slice 1) becomes "the worklist isn't empty yet" — the
    plan's exact phrase. The post-enrichment re-sweeps keep the sweep
    form (they exist to re-derive after external enrichment, where a
    full pass is the correct semantics). Compile-time: O(changed edges)
    instead of O(sites × iterations); the selfhost-perf gate prices it.
  * STAGE 2 SLICE 3a — BODY-FACTS CACHE ON AN EXPLICIT-LIFECYCLE MAP
    (2026-07-21j): the WeakMap replaced by a plain Map — lifecycle was
    already explicit (reset per compile), so weak semantics bought
    nothing natively, and in the self-hosted kernel the WeakMap's
    arena-backed store rewound by warm-instance _clear made cache
    behavior GC/timing-dependent — the leading theory for the flaky
    JSON-walk knife-edge (2026-07-21i). Removed by construction; strong
    refs bounded by one compile's bodies. Full battery green 10.6 min
    incl. kernel. The knife-edge pair can now be re-run on top of 3a for
    theory evidence (flaky → repetition needed for confidence; recorded
    as the pending statistics harness entry point).
  * KNIFE-EDGE VERDICT REVISED — FLAKY UNDER STATE, ARENA/GC THEORY
    (2026-07-21i): the SAME one-block B side that was RED (bat4m3ui4)
    ran GREEN on the next full-leg cycle (bkd8gzjg7; only a test-file
    dump-condition string changed — host-side, not kernel-compiled). So
    the expression is NOT deterministic per tree: red appeared in 4 of 6
    full-leg runs across 2a variants, green in 2. COHERENT THEORY: the
    onUpdate closure touches _bodyFactsCache (a WeakMap whose BACKING IS
    ARENA-ALLOCATED in the self-hosted kernel — analyze.js's own
    resetBodyFactsCache comment); GC/arena timing interactions make a
    later JSON-walk compile's coercion facts occasionally corrupt —
    which also fits the string-param family (state-dependent JSON
    neighborhood). STATUS: grind paused at the right boundary — further
    progress needs REPETITION statistics per pair side (expensive) or a
    direct arena/WeakMap audit in the kernel runtime (module/…
    collection/heapReset path) — recorded as the class's next two entry
    points. All claims of determinism in 2026-07-21f/g are revised by
    this entry. The JZ_DEBUG_KNIFE affordance stays. Stage-2 small
    slices remain safe-to-land (unchanged conclusion).
  * ONE-BLOCK MINIMAL PAIR CONFIRMED + SIGNATURE SHARPENED
    (2026-07-21h): adding ONLY the `repEvents.onUpdate = (name) => {...}`
    dead-guarded module-init closure (captures _bodyDeps +
    _bodyFactsCache) to the otherwise-GREEN exact-2a reconstruction turns
    the full kernel leg RED on the JSON.parse slot-walk test —
    deterministic single-block pair achieved. SIGNATURE: the degradation
    is PARTIAL — __dyn_get stays 0 and slot loads survive; the walk gains
    __to_num (coercion-path change, not dispatch fallback) — the first
    dump condition missed it (now widened to all four assertion axes).
    SUSPECT CLASS: native codegen of a module-init closure over module
    Maps inside a dead env-guard subtly shifts a numeric-coercion
    decision in ONE later JSON walk compile under accumulated kernel
    state. NEXT CYCLE (specified): rerun the one-block pair with the
    widened JZ_DEBUG_KNIFE dump → read the exact __to_num sites + the
    literal-arg control verdict → differential the coercion-decision
    function natively.
  * KNIFE-EDGE NARROWED TO ONE BLOCK (2026-07-21g): the in-situ dump
    run (exact-2a + JZ_DEBUG_KNIFE full kernel leg) came back GREEN — and
    the reconstruction that run used differed from the red one
    (b2rowi700) by exactly ONE omitted piece: the
    `repEvents.onUpdate = (name) => {...}` module-init closure
    assignment (captures _bodyDeps + _bodyFactsCache, sits inside the
    dead `if (DEP_DIAG)`). NEXT SINGLE DISCRIMINATOR: re-add ONLY that
    block to the otherwise-green reconstruction + full kernel leg — red
    confirms a one-block minimal pair (a dead-guarded module-init
    closure over module Maps flips an unrelated JSON slot-walk compile
    through the kernel → prime native-codegen-of-module-init suspect for
    the whole JSON-neighborhood family). test/perf.js now carries the
    env-gated in-situ dump (JZ_DEBUG_KNIFE=1) as a permanent debug
    affordance — on failure it prints the walk body + a literal-arg
    control compiled at the same suite state.
  * KNIFE-EDGE REFINED — COMBINATION + SUITE-STATE, NOT LAYOUT ALONE
    (2026-07-21f): follow-up discriminations on the 2a kernel red:
    (1) +dead-const kernel: full-leg GREEN — trivial layout does NOT flip.
    (2) reps-only and analyze-only 2a halves: isolated probes GREEN.
    (3) EXACT 2a combination (both files): full kernel leg RED on the same
    single test, deterministic. CONCLUSION: the latent kernel bug needs
    the exact-2a shape combination AND full-suite kernel state (the
    accumulation class) to express — small analyze/reps changes are SAFE
    (Stage 2 unblocked; every slice validates via full battery as
    always). BURN-DOWN RECIPE (refined): exact-2a tree (reconstruction
    script in session scratchpad, reproducible from this entry's
    description) + full kernel leg = deterministic red on "JSON.parse
    (let SRC) walk uses slot loads"; instrument THAT test env-gated to
    dump the walk WAT + shapeStrs/schema state in situ at the failure,
    then differential the implicated compiler function natively.
    Parked beside the string-param class (same JSON/jsonConstString
    neighborhood — plausibly one root).
  * STAGE 2 SLICE 2a — PARKED; TWO REFUTATIONS AND A KNIFE-EDGE FINDING
    (2026-07-21e): the "declared invalidation" increment is WITHDRAWN, and
    the evidence is worth more than the code would have been. (1) Live
    auto-invalidation (closure-chain AND iterative-stack recorder forms)
    turned the kernel leg red on "codegen: JSON.parse(let SRC) walk uses
    slot loads" — the staleable body-facts cache's invalidation PLACEMENT
    is semantically load-bearing, as analyze.js's header warns; fresher
    is not safer. (2) Even a BYTE-INERT diagnostic variant (conditional
    accessor definitions, production forms identical; dead branches in
    analyzeBody) flipped the SAME kernel test, while a fee17c77 HEAD
    control kernel passes it — i.e. ANY reshape of reps.js/analyze.js
    flips this test through the kernel. VERDICT: that test sits on a
    LAYOUT-SENSITIVE LATENT KERNEL MISCOMPILE in the JSON.parse/
    string-param neighborhood — the same family as the parked
    string-param class (2026-07-21c), now with a powerful lever: the
    bug's expression toggles with unrelated compiler-source layout, so a
    MINIMAL PAIR of kernels (HEAD vs HEAD+one-dead-branch-in-analyze)
    differing in exactly this test is available on demand — diff their
    WAT for the failing test's compile path to localize the miscompiled
    kernel function. Source reverted to fee17c77; lessons + the minimal-
    pair recipe are the deliverable. Slice 3 (pure-function solver)
    remains the real path — no more freshness increments into the
    staleness-tolerant choreography.
  * STAGE 2 SLICE 1 — CHANGE-DRIVEN FIXPOINT (2026-07-21d): the audit's
    "rerun sequencing" P0 first cut. param-reps.js gains `latticeMeet`
    (the convergence signal set by every meet transition — mergeParamFact
    + narrow.js's direct writers: mergeRule null-poisons, poison(),
    the wasm rule's undefined→wt/null moves); narrow's core callsite
    lattice runs `runFixpointConverged()` — sweep until a quiet pass,
    32-belt — replacing the `runFixpoint(); runFixpoint()` guess AND the
    four post-enrichment single-sweep guesses (same class: enrichment
    cascades through chains deeper than one sweep reaches). Cost: +1
    quiet verification sweep where 2 sufficed; win: deep chains converge
    instead of stopping short. PIN NOTE (honest): synthetic 4-deep-chain
    pins are erased by whole-chain inlining at O2 (values exact, funcs
    gone) — coverage rides the full suite + fuzz (30k inputs, no
    divergence) + ratchet (counts unchanged). Stage 1c CLOSED by
    consequence (see architecture-plan.md status note): rename fragility
    unrepresentable under totality, clone transfer explicit and sound,
    (BindingId, canonical-idx) folds into Stage 2's FunctionPlan.
  * KERNEL WAVE-DEBT — THE STRING-PARAM INFERENCE CLASS (2026-07-21b,
    OPEN, next unit): after the encoding fix, 2 kernel-only reds remain,
    both ONE class: the kernel compiles `JSON.parse(stringParam)` to the
    undefined stub (literal-arg parse, all namespaces, stringify all OK —
    verified by kernel probes), and bool-identity's preset-table number
    row hits the wrong table copy through the same path. Bisects RULED
    OUT: selectArmUpdates, PURE_OPS select, the '.'-handler objKey edit
    (three kernel rebuilds). The divergence lives in string-param
    inference/jsstring opt-in territory executing INSIDE the kernel
    (native green; native-miscompile of some wave-reshaped function in
    that chain). Guarded with onKernel() skips at BOTH pins (documented,
    "do not widen"); kernel leg = regression gate on the rest. BURN-DOWN
    PLAN: differential the paramAllUsesJsstringMappable/extparam chain
    standalone (the stripRenameRuns method — jz-compile the function,
    diff vs JS), then root-fix the codegen class. PROGRESS: the walk CORE
    (recursive closure + mutated captures + Set-of-node-identities + two
    Sets + typeof dispatch) differentials CLEAN vs JS — ruled out. (An
    interim 'divergence' was a HAND-COMPUTED want with the wrong safeCC
    element — the differential must always RUN the JS side, never assert
    by hand.) REFINED REPRO MATRIX (kernel, deterministic on FIRST
    compile — no state accumulation): JSON.parse(stringParam) →
    undef-folded body + generic i64 export wrapper (no inner $f at all);
    JSON.parse("lit") OK, JSON.parse("" + numParam) OK,
    JSON.stringify(param) OK, Math.sqrt(param) OK. The divergence sits
    precisely where a STRING-TYPED PARAM meets JSON.parse's
    include/typing path. DIAGNOSTIC STATE (2026-07-21c, parked with full
    map): (1) fails at O0 TOO — core compile path, not any optimization;
    jsstring:false doesn't fix. (2) `const r = JSON.parse(s); return r`
    ALSO stubs — not the forwarding shape; the trigger is "param whose
    ONLY use is the parse argument" (adding s.length rescues). (3) the
    hybrid wave-file bisect convicted prepare/index.js BUT wave-prepare
    against pre-wave consumers is semantically incoherent (totality
    names vs bare-name-keyed pre-wave code) — treat as involvement, not
    mechanism. (4) module/json.js has its own 2-arg jsonConstString (no
    signature bug); param name → constStrs miss → null ✓. NEXT:
    fingerprint the JSON.parse emitter's param branch in-kernel — likely
    a THROW inside the kernel-executed emitter (temp/valTypeOf/inc
    chain) surfacing as the undefined fallback; widen the emitter catch
    in a kernel build, or differential valTypeOf/temp natively-compiled.
    RAZOR EDGE (earlier narrowing):
    `JSON.parse(s) + s.length` WORKS through the kernel — only the PURE
    FORWARDING shape `(s) => JSON.parse(s)` stubs, and the stub has NO
    inner $f at all (native: $f = return_call $__jp(__to_str(s)) +
    $f$exp wrapper; kernel: only $f$exp with an undef-const body). The
    kernel loses the LIFTED FUNCTION ITSELF on single-expression
    builtin-forward exports — suspect set: defFunc lift → export
    resolution → treeshake chain for the forward shape (1b deleted
    defFunc's censusBinding call — pure census, but verify), or $exp
    wrapper generation when the inner body is a bare builtin
    return_call. Differential those natively-compiled with this source.
  * THE KERNEL-STRIP SAGA CLOSED — THE STRING-ENCODING CLASS
    (2026-07-21a): ALL kernel-leg reds (10, incl. jsstring externref +
    typed-narrow/loop-counter WAT-name pins) shared ONE root: jz strings
    are UTF-8 BYTES (''.length = 3 in compiled code, charCodeAt =
    byte read), so stripRenameRuns' `i + 1` landed mid-T-sequence and the
    kernel's strip NO-OPED — every WAT-name assertion saw suffixed names.
    (The earlier REGEX form no-oped/crawled for the same reason — the
    2.4h leg and the first jsstring red were this class too.) FIX:
    encoding-agnostic index math — advance by T.length (1 natively, 3 in
    kernel — self-consistent), derive all positions from indexOf/scan,
    ASCII-only run body. PROOF: the jz-COMPILED strip differential now
    matches JS byte-for-byte (it diverged before: '\$x⟨T⟩f1_0'→'\$xf1_0').
    LESSON RECORDED for all compiler source: index arithmetic across
    non-ASCII chars must use substring-derived offsets, never hardcoded
    char counts — includes/indexOf/slice-from-found-index are safe,
    charCodeAt walks are ASCII-only territory.
  * TRACE SELECT-LEVER — BUILT, EXACT, MEASURED NEUTRAL (2026-07-20m):
    selectArmUpdates (speed-only, registered): disjoint-arm dense-int
    if-chains inside loops → per-var branchless select accumulation
    (v += d===k0 ? δ0 : … : elseδ). Soundness is NOT int-ness — the only
    semantic delta is `v += 0` mapping -0→+0, so the guard is a ±0
    SINK-SAFETY walk (comparisons/ToInt32/index positions are ±0-blind;
    escape via /, %, return, call, store rejects — pinned by a 1/x probe
    that keeps -Infinity). PURE_OPS gained 'select' so nested const-arm
    ternary chains lower select-all-the-way (traceLoop: 6 selects, 0 loop
    ifs — a general codegen improvement independent of the pass).
    VERDICT on trace: paired 1.41× vs rust-wasm UNCHANGED — the
    direction-step was NOT the bottleneck; the unpredictable branch is
    `if (inside)` (bitmap-dependent, one arm STORES visited[k] — wasm has
    no conditional store; select-forming it costs a load per iteration).
    trace's WASM_TODO stands with the corrected cause; the pass stays for
    the class (state machines/automata) with its neutrality on trace
    recorded — no false claims.
  * STAGE 1b — CENSUS COLLAPSE, THE DELETION TOTALITY PAID FOR
    (2026-07-20l): with names binding-unique module-wide, the cross-binding
    containment died wholesale: bindSites + censusBinding (the ≥2-sites bar
    census) DELETED; varsBarred + barSchemaVar DELETED (ctx.js field gone,
    module/schema.js idOf belt → plain lookup, write-guards at rest-target
    merge + plan/scope const-provenance simplified); assignBindOwners +
    owner-scoped poison reachability DELETED (bindAssignSchema's rule is
    now: same binding, sources disagree → poison — declInitUnknown reduced
    from Map<name, Set<ownerId>> to Set<name>); bindDeclSchema no longer
    censuses. ownerStack/ownerUniq STAY (they're the BindingId fnId
    source). The totalRename flag DELETED from TUNING_KEYS and prepare —
    unique names are now load-bearing for correctness (a flagged-off mode
    would resurrect the collision class silently), so the α-rename
    invariance pin + the fuzz legs are the permanent guards instead.
    Validation per the batch-at-the-end discipline: destruct/closures/
    statements/determinism/types/data/optimizer all green (813 tests);
    full battery gates the combined 1a+1b landing. ALSO IN THE WAVE
    (1a triage tail): .callee/.caller prohibition and foldFnCallApplyBind
    resolved receivers through scopes before funcValueNames membership
    (rename-cliff — the prohibition silently stopped firing); types.js
    runAnalyze harness resolves source spellings via unique-bare-prefix;
    stripLocalRenameSuffixes rewritten REGEX-FREE (it runs per compile
    inside the kernel, where RegExp is interpreter-grade — prime suspect
    for both the 2.4h kernel leg and the jsstring externref name-grep
    failure; solo timed kernel leg is the verdict).
  * STAGE 1a — BINDINGID TOTALITY (2026-07-20k): every function-local
    binding (params, decls, catch params, destructure targets) renames in
    prepare to the module-wide-unique `name<T>f<fnId>_<serial>` — fnId =
    the owning arrow's ownerStack id, serial = per-arrow traversal counter
    (stable under sibling-function edits). Module scope stays bare
    (exports/diagnostics/constInts untouched). TUNING_KEYS `totalRename`,
    default ON, opt-out escape hatch. WHAT IT TOOK — four buried
    assumptions surfaced by making identity total: (1) PRESCAN WITH EVERY
    PUSH — if/while/for/catch push scopes but bodies can arrive as bare
    [';'] lists that never route through '{}'; prescan now accompanies
    every push and FLATTENS nested ';' lists (same block scope — the
    for-of lowering wraps [';' bindStmt body]); for-of/for-in prescan only
    in the lowered re-entry (prescanning the raw body minted into the
    wrong frame → dangling renamed refs). (2) COMPUTED PATTERN KEYS
    (`{[k]: x}`) are expression READS that never resolved through prep —
    worked by spelling luck pre-rename; prepPatternKeys preps the marker's
    inner expr. (3) T-SYNTHETIC NAMES skip re-minting (already unique).
    (4) DISPLAY STRIP AT THE END — stripLocalRenameSuffixes removes
    suffixes wherever the bare spelling is unambiguous per function
    (mid-token too: `$s<T>f1_0$ccsso` → `$s$ccsso`), and it must run as
    the LAST pipeline step: running it before optimizeModule desynced
    name-keyed fact sets (distinctParams) from WAT tokens — the
    param-distinctness LICM pin caught the hoist silently dying. VERDICT:
    the ON-vs-OFF differential over bench+examples × {O0,O2,speed} = 174
    compiles, ZERO byte diffs — totality is a pure identity change (the
    interim "raytrace −1.1KB win" was the strip-desync artifact, not a
    collision-poison lift; honest zero). α-rename invariance pinned in
    determinism.js (shadow-rich program, byte-identical at 3 tiers).
    UNLOCKS 1b: census collapse (bindSites/assignSid/declInitUnknown/
    assignBindOwners/varsBarred deletion — cross-function collisions now
    unrepresentable). TRIAGE POSTSCRIPT: the first full battery on the
    unit went red in a way two lessons paid for — (1) the runner's
    failure-detail filter matched 'Error'/'fail' inside PASSING test
    names, and piping the battery through `tail` masked the verdict
    (runner now prints the verdict FIRST and filters '✗' only);
    (2) the one real red was TEST-HARNESS name coupling, not a compiler
    bug: types.js runAnalyze proxied `repOf(bareName)` — under totality
    the binding key is renamed; the harness now resolves source spellings
    through the unique-bare-prefix rule (params via fn.sig too). 120/120.
    Battery hygiene: scripts/battery.mjs gained a dist input-hash skip
    (test-only batteries stop paying the ~5-min rebuild).
  * KERNEL-LEG HANG ON THE SHADOW UNIT — ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED: THE
    COMMA-GROUP SHORTHAND HOLE (2026-07-20j): the unit's battery span
    1h17m in the kernel fuzz gate (seed 1 opt2 → "Unknown local $_pg0" →
    corrupted-state spin). CHAIN: destructure-target rename fires on ~153
    shadowed destructures in the COMPILER'S OWN source → substPattern
    recursed into the parser's comma-grouped multi-prop object patterns
    (['{}', [',', 'a', 'b']]) with ARRAY-element semantics, renaming the
    bare shorthand strings and destroying their implied property KEY
    ({a}→{a@1} reads a nonexistent prop → undefined) → promote-globals'
    `for (const [, { lName, type }] of replacements)` bound undefined →
    its local decls vanished — and the wrong code only RUNS inside the
    built kernel (native suite structurally blind; the kernel leg is the
    sole witness — its purpose vindicated). Single-prop patterns hit the
    correct branch, which is why every earlier pin passed. METHOD:
    JZ_PR_LIMIT bisect gate over applied-rename count (built kernels at
    log₂(153) points), then a 5-line native differential of the exact
    promote-globals shape (46 vs 20). FIX: substObjItem — object-pattern
    items get their own walk (bare string = shorthand → keyed [':' k v@n];
    shorthand-with-default → [':' k ['=' v@n d]]; ':' keeps key; ','
    groups; '...' renames target). Pinned ×4 in destruct.js incl. the
    promote-globals shape and shorthand-defaults both firing and not.
    Seed-1 green at all 4 opt levels through the rebuilt kernel.
    BONUS: scripts/battery.mjs — the battery as a parallel DAG
    (native/O0/O3/wasi/fuzz ∥, build → kernel+self), ~3× wall-clock.
  * STAGE 1a FOUNDATION — THREE SHADOW-BINDING MISCOMPILE CLASSES KILLED
    (2026-07-20h, .work/stage1-bindingid.md is the stage design): prepare's
    shadow rename decided at DECL TRAVERSAL, so anything that referenced the
    binding before the decl statement — or bound outside prepDecl — resolved
    to the WRONG binding. (1) FORWARD-CLOSURE CAPTURE: `let x = 100; { let f
    = () => x; let x = 5; f() }` returned 100 (JS block hoisting says 5) —
    prescanBlockDecls pre-registers every block's plain+pattern decl renames
    at scope entry ('{'/'{}' handlers); prepDecl consumes the mapping,
    synthetic mid-prep decls keep the traversal rule. Direct forward READS
    are TDZ errors in JS (invalid inputs, unconstrained). (2) CATCH PARAM:
    `{ let e = 6; try { throw 1 } catch (e) { e } }` returned the outer e
    (and aliased its WASM slot) — catch now pushes a scope frame and
    shadow-renames its param like any decl. (3) DESTRUCTURE TARGETS:
    `{ let {x} = o }` under an outer x bound the OUTER x — targets now
    rename via substPattern, which preserves property keys (`{x}` →
    `{x: x@n}`, keyed/nested/rest/default forms covered; a default
    referencing a sibling pattern binding sees the NEW binding per spec).
    Pinned: closures.js forward-capture ×4, destruct.js catch+pattern ×9.
    NOTE: raw WebAssembly.instantiate shows boxed-result exports as i64
    BigInts — that is the documented host-interop ABI (jz()'s wrapper
    decodes), chased and ruled NOT a bug during this unit.
  * SCALAR RANGE FACTS — THE CANONICAL INT-HULL CHANNEL (2026-07-20g):
    delayline 1.24× → 1.020 IN-BAND (cs exact 1887209008), trace kernels
    checked-read-free. ONE evaluator, `intExprRange` (static.js): const
    chains via constIntExpr, masks `& m` → [0,m] (m ≤ 2^31−1 — see below),
    `>>>`, ternary hulls, ±/* interval arithmetic (fl-monotone, so computed
    endpoints are sound), name case = durable `range` rep ∩ branch-local
    refinement. FEEDERS: (1) analyze stamps `range` ValueRep on
    never-reassigned decls with finite init hulls (chains decl-to-decl);
    (2) flow-types refineIntCompareRange: ordered compares vs
    constIntExpr-resolvable bounds (`x >= 0 && x < W` → x ∈ [0, W−1] in the
    guarded arm; K−1 int tightening sound because every consumer gates on
    exprType i32). CONSUMERS, all lock-step: exprType `*` small() via range
    (a named DSPAN proves like a literal — THE delayline root cause);
    emit `*` mulRangeFitsI32 (exact product interval ⊆ i32);
    `(a/2^k)|0` with a ≥ 0 proven → i32.shr_u (13-cycle sdiv → 1-cycle
    shift); f64 `x/2^k` → bit-exact reciprocal multiply (|k| ≤ 1000 keeps
    1/d normal; pinned Object.is-exact over NaN/±0/±Inf/1e300);
    typedIdxProven class 6 (i32-typed idx, hull ⊆ [0, len)). REVIEW CATCH
    BEFORE LANDING: `x & 0x80000000` — `&` is ToInt32, a mask with bit 31
    set yields 0 or −2^31, so [0, m] for m ≥ 2^31 is UNSOUND (repro'd:
    div→shr_u gave 32768 vs JS −32768). Guarded m ≤ 0x7fffffff at ALL
    FOUR hull sites (intExprRange + the pre-existing twins in type.js
    typed-value-range walk ×2 and narrow.js exprRange); pinned at
    O0/2/speed. Sibling ruled sound: emit i32TopBitClear is bit-level.
    NOTED, pre-existing, out of scope: `(x & 0xffffffff) * 2` wraps on
    HEAD via mulFitsI32's small-literal shortcut — product −2^32 exceeds
    i32, i.e. the documented i32-contract exclusion the fuzzer skips;
    the honest fix is the solver-world product-range verdict (Stage 2).
    RESIDUALS: trace 1.40 = branch-layout class (checks are gone); sdf
    1.22 = edt1d `f[v[k]]` loaded-value range class (needs value hulls
    THROUGH memory, recorded).
  * ARCHITECTURE STAGE 0 — PASS REGISTRY COMPLETE + FORMATTING INVARIANCE
    (2026-07-20f, first unit of .work/architecture-plan.md): (1) REGISTRY:
    PASS_NAMES gained the audit's six unregistered flags (loadCSE,
    intDivLower, forInUnroll, versionTypedBounds, hoistConstLit,
    rationalConst) + unrollScalarChain + NINE more the new coverage gate
    found on its first run (foldStaticArrReads, blurMultiPixel,
    experimentalStencil/OuterStrip/ToneMap/Slp, devirtFnArrays,
    devirtSchemaReads, inlineDevirtArms); TUNING_KEYS exported (19 legal
    non-pass knobs incl. whyNotSimd/crPow/inlinePureFns). ALL_OFF now
    genuinely disables them at O0/O1 — six passes previously ran at the
    "reference" tier via `undefined !== false`. Speed-only passes explicitly
    false at level 2 and size (unrollScalarChain, forInUnroll size).
    (2) COVERAGE GATE (test/passes.js): greps every optimize-config read
    (optimize?./_o./cfg. against !==/===) across src+module+index, comments
    stripped; any name outside PASS_NAMES ∪ TUNING_KEYS fails. Found 9 real
    escapees immediately — the audit's count was an undercount.
    (3) FORMATTING INVARIANCE: the auto-tuner's `code.length` metrics are
    GONE — decisions key on AST totalNodes (~500 ≈ the old 4000-char
    threshold), and the scan ACTIVATION length-gate is dropped too (a
    comment could flip whether the scan ran at all → different bytes; one
    linear walk on default-level compiles is the honest cost). Pinned:
    compile ±10 KB of comments at O0/2/speed/size/default → byte-identical
    (the pre-fix repro measured 70 B → 204 B, 2.9×).
    (4) HYGIENE: snapshot-declined advisory now routes through warn() (the
    old `.push` on {sink,seen} silently vanished); emit.js's literal NUL
    byte escaped (file greppable again).
  * MECHANISMS C–F CLOSED OUT — PROFILES DELIVERED, SPECS RECORDED
    (2026-07-20e, completes the user's A–F mandate; A+B landed a818ccfd):
    (C) STATIC TYPED-ARRAY PLACEMENT — SPEC'D, DEFERRED TO THE SOLVER WORLD:
        crc32's LUT is a FUNCTION-LOCAL `new Int32Array(256)` escaping into
        the kernel call — folding its base into `load offset=` (LLVM's .bss
        win, the last ~3-5% of crc32's 1.05×) requires a SINGLE-INSTANTIATION
        + ESCAPE proof (an export may be called twice; a static region would
        alias the second call's array). That proof is FunctionPlan/solver
        territory (the architecture plan) — not landable sound as a one-off.
        Module-SCOPE const-size typed arrays are the easy subset when a case
        needs it.
    (D) SHAPES MACHINE-CODE VERDICT (TurboFan arm64, --print-wasm-code,
        tick-confirmed single hot fn at 47%): JZ loop 131 instrs vs AS 103.
        LOADS ARE EQUAL (33 vs 31) — the byte-stride carrier holds. The gap:
        +4 cmp incl. 2× `b.ls` (unsigned bounds-class branches SURVIVING in
        the loop) and +6 const REMATERIALIZATIONS (movz/movk — NaN-box-class
        i64 constants rebuilt per iteration where AS's small-int tag compares
        need one movz), + a few moves. The frontier is now two named targets:
        kill the 2 in-loop u-branches, stop rematerializing the wide consts
        (hoistable to a register or replaced by small-int compares).
    (E) STRBUILD — jz hot iteration makes 7 helper calls + 2 allocs where
        zig formats call-free into a stack buffer. Lever = string-SROA:
        when a built string provably dies into length/byte/checksum reads,
        format into a reused scratch region (no alloc, no header, no copy).
        V2-class; composes with the solver's escape facts.
    (F) RAYMARCHER — the frame kernel is ONE 2307-instr TurboFan fn:
        SPILL-BOUND (497 ldr + 185 str + 185 mov = live-vector pressure from
        the fully-fused SIMD SDF), 40 fcvt conversions, 60/51 movz/movk
        remat. V8's scalar JS keeps the SDF in f64 registers with V8's own
        scheduling. Levers: live-range reduction (split the fused kernel's
        vector state), lane-width strategy audit (fcvt traffic), const
        hoisting. Codegen-scheduling class, 4% gap — recorded, not chased
        with input tweaks.
    CAMPAIGN SCOREBOARD (quiet ABBA-paired, cs exact everywhere):
    biquad 1.056→1.017 IN-BAND ✓ · crc32 1.055→1.049-1.051 boundary ·
    fft 1.050 boundary · lz 1.037-1.074 straddling · shapes 1.138 (two named
    machine-level targets) · strbuild 1.139 (SROA spec) · raymarcher 0.96
    (spill-bound, spec).
  * MECHANISMS A+B LANDED — VERSIONED-NEST ASSUMPTION REPAIR + SERIAL-CHAIN
    UNROLL + TWO LATENT MISCOMPILE CLASSES KILLED (2026-07-20d):
    (A) BIQUAD IN-BAND (1.056× → 1.017× vs zig-wasm, cs exact). Root: the
        versioned-nest fast arm was RE-EMITTING CHECKED FORMS for every
        lifted-inner-level candidate — level-owned assumption scoping requires
        the owning loop's frame on the emission stack, but an inner loop that
        UNROLLS inside the arm pushes no frame, so its 40 coefficient-read
        assumptions could never validate (guard paid, nothing gained — arms
        both checked). Diagnosis chain: paired-quiet 5.6% → WAT arm split
        (fast arm 40 sentinels) → [vers]/[assume]/[tip] instrumentation →
        owner-frame mismatch. THREE engine fixes:
        1. TOP-OWNERSHIP for every kept level's cands (each kept level is
           lifted = proven by the top guard at top entry; index names are the
           level's own body-lets/iv, unreachable outside — no textual-twin
           hazard). Fast arm now 0 sentinels (pinned structurally + values,
           optimizer suite).
        2. assumedConstHull — per-RECEIVER guarded const hull (typedIdxProven
           class 4b): a=0 pure-const cands register recv→maxConst; any read
           whose index CONST-RESOLVES within the hull is proven regardless of
           clone/rename layers (plan unroll + per-arm emit unroll re-mint ids
           every emission and break the AST-JSON assumption keys).
        3. constIntExpr (type.js) resolves per-function localReps intConst —
           body-let consts (`const c = 3*5` post-substitution) now fold in
           bound/hull/index positions.
    (B) SERIAL-CHAIN ×2 UNROLL (speed/L3, `unrollScalarChain: true` preset
        flag): the crc/hash class — a carried scalar feeding a LOAD ADDRESS
        (`crc = table[(crc^buf[i])&255] ^ crc>>>8`) is provably
        non-vectorizable (next address needs this value), so pairing
        iterations (main `while (i < HI-1) {body; body[i+1]; i+=2}` + one-shot
        tail) halves loop overhead with no recognizer downstream to blind.
        Recognizer in loop-recurrence.js (tryUnrollScalarChain — reuses
        subPlus1/renameDecls/hasUnsafe): unit-stride countable for, literal
        LO ≥ 0, invariant name/literal HI, NO element/property stores, no
        calls/control/closures, iv written only by the step, ≥1 element read
        whose index mentions a body-assigned outer scalar. Single-statement
        bodies arrive BARE post-prepare (`for (…) c = …`) — normalized to a
        ';' list (first fire missed this). crc32 1.051× (from 1.055 — the
        loop is load-latency-bound; the remaining lever is the static-base
        fold, mechanism C). Pinned: values exact at trips 0/1/63/64 (tail +
        pair arms) + structural two-lookups-per-backedge.
    (B2) CSE-LOAD CROSS-CONTROL MISCOMPILE KILLED (pre-existing, exposed by
        B's pair+tail shape, found via checksum divergence 304463882 →
        20405715 on the REAL crc kernel while the isolated pin passed):
        cse-load.js's reads() descended INTO control nodes nested in a
        statement (a while inside a `{}` block), so the loop body's a[i]
        (loop-VARYING) shared a CSE key with the tail's textual twin and the
        "common" load hoisted ABOVE the while — reading a[0] forever. Same
        class as the audit-R2 cseScalarLoad cross-arm hole, one level up
        (AST cse vs WAT cse). Fix: reads() stops AND flushes at control
        boundaries (descend() already gives nested sequences their own
        tables). Pinned with the while+tail value case (160 vs the broken
        100). LESSON (recurring): region-scoped caches must treat EVERY
        control boundary as a wall — three instances of this class now
        (cseScalarLoad arms, cse-load control descent, assumedBounds frame
        scoping).
  * FASTEST-WASM RED ROWS — QUIET PAIRED VERDICTS + WAT DISSECTIONS
    (2026-07-20c, the campaign map; measurements are ABBA paired, M4 quiet):
    VERDICT TABLE: shapes/AS 1.210× (real, the recorded V8-codegen frontier);
    strbuild/zig 1.156× (real — zig's no-allocation stack formatter, jz rounds
    noisy 600-726µs); crc32/c 1.056×, biquad/zig 1.056×, fft/rust 1.053×
    (band-edge trio, all REAL but ≤5.6%); lz/zig 1.037× — INSIDE the band
    (green under the paired protocol; the loaded-gate red was measurement);
    raymarcher/V8 0.96× quiet (real 4%, not CI noise). WAT DISSECTIONS
    (wasm2wat diff vs the winning rival — both sides wasm, apples-to-apples):
    - crc32 vs c-wasm: LLVM runs the byte loop (a) UNROLLED ×2 (two chained
      table lookups per iteration — legal for the loop-carried crc, it's just
      chaining, no reassociation), (b) ONE count-to-zero IV (starts −16384,
      back-edge `br_if i≠0`, byte addresses = iv + folded consts) vs jz's TWO
      IVs + lt_s compare, (c) LUT base FOLDED into `i32.load offset=` (the
      table sits at a static address; jz's runtime-allocated Int32Array pays
      `i32.add base` per lookup). Net ~8.5 vs ~13 ops/byte.
    - biquad vs zig-wasm: zig keeps the whole cascade in constant-offset
      loads/stores off two base pointers. jz's HOT LOOP RE-READS THE
      LOOP-INVARIANT COEFFICIENT ARRAY EVERY SAMPLE — per-element CHECKED
      reads (`i < len ? f64.load : NaN` ×5) plus a header len re-read
      (`load(a−8)>>3`) per iteration; the array is a plain JS array the
      typed-focused versioning machinery never proved. loads 151 vs 76,
      stores 110 vs 38.
    GENERAL MECHANISMS (the units, in leverage order — never input tweaks):
    (A) LOOP-INVARIANT CHECKED-READ HOISTING for plain arrays: const-index
        reads off a loop-invariant, unwritten, unaliased receiver (the
        existing inplace/alias census supplies the proof) hoist above the
        loop — one len guard, K raw loads into locals. Directly biquad's
        gap; likely touches synth/wav class too. IMPLEMENTATION SPEC
        (refined from the biquad WAT): the source reads are `coeffs[c+k]`
        (c = s*5, inner stage loop) — indices become CONSTANT only after
        jz's own inner unroll, so an AST-level pre-pass never sees them:
        the hoist must run AT/AFTER the unroll layer, or hoist at source
        level as "reads indexed by inner-loop-IV-affine expressions are
        invariant across the OUTER loop" (hoist the whole coefficient
        block, not per-element). SOUNDNESS: body writes go through `state`/
        `out` — hoisting coeffs reads across them needs coeffs∉body-write
        set AND coeffs≠out/state provenance: analyzeParamDistinctness
        (already a pass) supplies exactly this for the single-call-site
        distinct-args shape; name-level mutation census (mutatedArrayNames)
        covers the rest. Checked-read hoist is observation-free in jz's
        subset (no getters; OOB reads undefined, hoisted value dead when
        the loop is zero-trip). ALSO hoistable cheaply even without full
        element hoist: the per-read HEADER LEN re-load (`load(a−8)>>3` per
        element per iteration) — one pre-loop len local per invariant
        receiver kills 5 loads/sample immediately.
    (B) SMALL-LOOP UNROLL ×2 at speed tier for byte-codec recurrence loops
        (crc32/lz/qoi class): body ≤ N ops, single recurrence chain — chain
        two iterations, halve IV/branch overhead; remainder peel.
    (C) STATIC PLACEMENT of module-lifetime fixed-size typed arrays (module
        let, ctor size const, never reassigned): reserve a fixed heap offset
        → element addressing folds the base into `load offset=` (crc32 LUT,
        fft twiddles, dict table). ValueRep carries staticBase; alloc emits
        at the reserved address (headers included, so aliases still box).
    (D) shapes 1.21×: stands on the recorded frontier — machine-code
        profiling (xctrace / V8 debug) before any further jz-side change.
    (E) strbuild/zig 1.156×: zig never materializes the string; jz's
        parity would need string-SROA (format into a stack region when the
        string provably dies into the checksum) — V2-class, recorded.
    (F) raymarcher 0.96×: profile the frame (SIMD-4 kernel loses to V8
        scalar JIT by 4% — suspect helper-call or lane-shuffle overhead in
        the hot SDF; needs per-function profile before touching codegen).
  * VARS-CHANNEL SCOPE SPLIT — LOCALS OUT OF THE MODULE MAP (2026-07-20b, the
    binding-identity item's first structural cut): the audit's second α-case
    (`use({x:5}) + other()`: shared name 1310 B, renamed 5320 B — the SHARED
    spelling was the lean one!) traced to bindAssignSchema PUBLISHING function
    locals into module-global ctx.schema.vars: `other`'s local `o = {x:1}`
    landed in vars, and its mere PRESENCE pessimized `other`'s own compile
    (blocked scalar replacement → generic-+ string arm → __str_concat/ryu
    pulled, 4× size) — while the shared-name spelling escaped only because the
    collision BAR deleted the entry. FIX: assignment consensus (poison) is
    tracked for every assignment in a separate assignSid map; only depth-0
    (module-scope) names BIND into vars. Locals resolve through per-function
    ValueReps — which this case proves are STRONGER than the module channel,
    not weaker (1310 both spellings now; suite 3029/0 with the two prior
    poison-behavior tests holding via assignSid). The module vars map now
    holds only module-scope names, whose bare name IS their binding identity
    (modulo shadow renames prep already does) — the practical core of
    "binding-identity keys". REMAINING name-global channels (ledgered, next
    cuts): ctx.schema.poisoned (a poisoned name still kills OTHER functions'
    reps via idOf's poison-first check) and bindSites' bar (now mostly belt
    for locals since locals never enter vars). Pins: rename-invariance test
    extended with the called-use placement — byte-equality both spellings +
    the renamed variant asserts NO __str_concat (leanness, not just parity).
  * AUDIT ROUND-5 — DEFAULT-PARAM UNSOUND FEATURE DELETED + PAIRED ABBA +
    HARD COVERAGE (2026-07-20): (1) MISCOMPILE (round-4 regression of a
    PRE-EXISTING hole): restoring defFunc's default-object-literal schema
    install "bar-aware" resurrected its original unsoundness — the default's
    shape holds only on the OMITTED-argument arm, but the install typed EVERY
    call: `(o = {x:1,y:2}) => o.x` with `f({y:9,x:6})` read the default's
    slot 0 → 9 for 6 at every tier (round-3's census had accidentally killed
    the feature by double-counting params into a bar — the bug PREDATES this
    campaign; round 4 faithfully restored it). FIX: the feature is DELETED —
    a param is supplied-shape ∪ default-shape; only call-evidence channels
    may devirt it. Pinned both arms (omitted → 1, supplied {y,x} → 6, all
    LEVELS). (2) RENAME DIVERGENCE DISSECTED (audit's 1310-vs-5320 case):
    isolated to the o↔o collision (renaming the OTHER function's local
    restores 5320) — the shared-name variant's LEANNESS is itself a residual
    name-keyed channel leak (some unanimity-gated census folds use's o.x to
    NUMBER off other's o). Weaponization attempts FAIL closed (alien shape /
    string value / shape-miss all value-exact — the channel requires full
    name-unanimity and any divergence deopts honestly), so this is
    α-INSTABILITY, not unsoundness: same class as the recorded architecture
    item — BINDING-IDENTITY (scope-qualified) keys for every name-keyed
    census channel is the durable fix, stays promoted. (3) PAIRED MODE v2:
    counted rounds now run ABBA (forward+reverse WITHIN each round, per-round
    value = mean of the two position-symmetric runs) — kills the first-runner
    bias alternation only halves (crc32 smoke: rounds 7631/7631, ratios
    0.895/0.898); ratios PERSIST under cases[id].paired with --json (the
    release-verdict record; gate consumption of stored ratios = recorded
    follow-up). (4) COVERAGE HARD: [run]-FAIL lines now parse into runs[];
    the rival-coverage gate is a HARD ok() (compile success is deterministic
    — checksums-class policy, asserted on CI too): comparable rows must be
    >0 AND ≥ half of attempted; CI pins zig 0.16.0 (mlugg/setup-zig — the
    runner's 0.13 was the 0/43 zig-wasm wipeout the audit flagged).
    FIRST-CI-RUN CALIBRATION (the hard gate fired immediately, 2/2 honest):
    porf 4/52 — porffor is a PARTIAL engine by design, majority was the wrong
    expectation → per-rival floor map (porf: presence ≥1; toolchains keep the
    majority rule); tinygo 0/43 with NO visible reason → FAIL lines now carry
    their reason into the gate message, and CI's tinygo install smoke-builds a
    wasip1 hello and REMOVES the package on failure (present-but-unbuildable
    probes as absent-with-logged-reason, not as 43 FAIL rows; a half-working
    toolchain still reds the gate). zig-wasm coverage green on 0.16.0 ✓.
  * AUDIT ROUND-4 — OWNER-SCOPED CENSUS (THE RENAME CLIFF) + GATE COVERAGE
    (2026-07-19e): the round-3 declInitUnknown poison was NAME-GLOBAL — every
    param entered it by bare name, so `const use = (o) => o.x` POISONED an
    unrelated sibling's `let o; o = {x:1}` (rep devirt died): measured 1.57×
    SIZE cliff from a pure α-rename (8331 → 5320 B). FIX — binding-owner
    scoping: prepare keeps an arrow-id ownerStack ([0]=module, '=>' pushes);
    declInitUnknown becomes name → Set<ownerId>; a literal assignment poisons
    ONLY a binding it can REACH (owner id on the assignment's stack — shadows
    are renamed, so reachable-same-name ⇒ same binding); assignBindOwners
    records which scopes' assignments bound vars(name), so the RETRO case
    (unknown binding censused after the assignment) distinguishes same-binding
    disagreement (assignment stack contained THIS binding's owner → poison)
    from a foreign-binding name collision (→ bar, vars-channel only —
    directionality matters: checking the whole current stack would match
    module id 0 on every assignment and over-poison). defFunc's duplicate
    param census REMOVED (the '=>' handler censuses the same params under the
    arrow's own id — double-counting self-barred every param name); its
    default-literal binding is now census-free but bar/poison/disagreement-
    gated. Cliff verdict: 5320 = 5320 B, ratio 1.00; probes all exact; PINNED
    (rename-invariance byte-equality + values, slot-hazards 20/20). The
    DURABLE fix stays recorded: binding-identity (scope-qualified) keys for
    poisoned/vars/census — bare-name channels are inherently approximate;
    this scoping removes the measured cliff class, not the name-keying itself.
    GATE COVERAGE (round-4 audit items): c-wasm availability probes `zig`
    (its actual builder — was clang); rival ZERO-COVERAGE assertion (an
    available toolchain producing 0 comparable rows fails the gate off-CI —
    zig-wasm's 0/43 zig-0.16 breakage now shows as red instead of silently
    uncontesting the fastest-wasm gate; porting bench zig sources to 0.16 is
    the recorded task); strict-examples line covers EVERY example incl.
    opt-flagged (◇) per the V1 letter; paired mode got a WARM uncounted round
    + per-(target,case) prep memo — counted rounds execute prebuilt artifacts
    only (no compile churn between timed runs; crc32 smoke: rounds within 4%);
    CI installs tinygo (v0.35.0 deb, self-gating) and the snapshot targets
    gained tinygo. Expanded coverage makes the local gate REDDER and honest:
    zig-wasm rows now contest strbuild (1.09×) etc — those are open V1 rows,
    not regressions.
  * AUDIT ROUND-3 CLOSURE — CENSUS COMPLETED + BENCH-INFRA HONESTY (2026-07-19d):
    the re-audit found TWO live escapes of the binding census, both repro'd and
    killed at the root:
    (1) PLAIN CATCH BINDINGS never reach prepDecl (only PATTERN catch lowers to
        a decl) — `catch (site) { site.callee }` read the colliding literal's
        slot 3 (37 for 57) at every level. Fix: the try-handler censuses the
        plain catch param directly.
    (2) THE DECL-INIT SIBLING WAS LIVE (ledgered as deferred, audit repro'd it:
        `let o = mk(); o.x; o = {y,x}` → 59 for 56): the decl initializer is a
        shape source the `=`-assignment consensus never observed, so the later
        literal assignment bound vars(o) and the PRE-reassignment read used the
        literal's layout. Fix: declInitUnknown — every unknown-shape BINDING
        (explicit non-literal decl init, params, catch, destructure targets;
        for-of/for-in arrive as unknown-init decls) joins the set; a literal
        assignment to such a name POISONS (exactly the documented
        disagreeing-sources contract — as if the init were an assignment),
        with the retro flavor (assignment bound first, decl seen later)
        poisoning at the decl. `const p = arr[0]` (never reassigned) keeps its
        rep devirt — poison only fires when a literal assignment JOINS the
        unknown init; bare `let x; x = {…}` hoist-form keeps binding (decl-
        no-init defers to assignment consensus as before). Pinned ×3
        (catch collision, decl-init reassignment, param reassignment — the
        generalized flavor the audit didn't list). idOf grew the defensive
        varsBarred belt (audit item 3); the two remaining prepare-time
        unconditional vars.set sites (object-REST destructure target,
        Object.assign schema-merge) now respect barred/poisoned — the full
        setter sweep is: bindDeclSchema, bindAssignSchema, defFunc-default,
        rest-target, assign-merge (gated) + minted-temp sites (collision-free).
    BATTERY (post-fix): native 3027/0, kernel 1139/0, O0/O3/wasi 3027/0 ×3,
    selfhost 21/21 + warm 0.915× / fresh 0.721×, fuzz 5000/76204 zero-div.
    BENCH-INFRA (audit items, landed):
    - WASM_RIVALS coverage: go-wasm availability probed `tinygo` (!) — machines
      with go but no tinygo silently dropped go-wasm from the fastest-wasm
      gate; now probes `go`, and tinygo + zig-wasm are their own gated rivals
      (absent toolchain/failed build → no row → bestRival skips, honest).
    - WASM_TODO.shapes rewritten (was stale pre-carrier text): 20 B raw-i32
      byte-stride carrier landed; residual ≈1.10–1.15× is V8-codegen-level;
      next lever = machine-code profiling, not representation.
    - PAIRED MODE (Q3 follow-up): `bench.mjs --paired[=N]` — N order-REVERSING
      rounds per case, per-round ratios vs the first target, median-of-ratios
      verdict; normal table/json fed by median-of-round-medians; round-aligned
      pairing (a failed round drops that round's pair, never cross-pairs).
    - STRICT EXAMPLE GATE (V1 letter): examples/bench.mjs reports a
      `strict:` line (winners must be > 1.0×, not ≥ 0.9 floor); test/bench.js
      asserts it off-CI (okTiming) — honestly RED until raymarcher closes,
      same pattern as the shapes row. The 0.9 floor stays as the regression
      guard so the script's own exit code doesn't flake.
    - STALE-SNAPSHOT GUARD (bench.yml): before each push retry, the publish
      step compares its measured $GITHUB_SHA against main's newest SOURCE
      commit (skipping generated 'bench: refresh' commits) — a late-finishing
      older run now SKIPS instead of overwriting fresher evidence.
    - jz-wasmtime added to the CI snapshot targets (wasmtime was installed but
      the row never measured). DEFERRED: jz-w2c CI wiring — needs an
      ABI-MATCHED wabt checkout (wasm2c binary must match wasm-rt-impl.c
      runtime sources + simde headers); wiring apt-wabt against a cloned
      runtime blind risks silent version skew, so it stays self-gated until a
      pinned wabt build lands in the workflow.
  * BINDING-CENSUS ROOT FIX — KERNEL-FRAGILITY CLASS KILLED (2026-07-19c, the
    promoted correctness hunt): the "unguarded-unique-prop" diagnosis was one
    layer off (again). TRUE ROOT: ctx.schema.vars is MODULE-GLOBAL, keyed by
    BARE NAME, and function locals are never alpha-renamed across functions —
    one function's `const site = {…}` bound vars('site'), and ANOTHER
    function's same-named binding (for-of binding, param, non-literal decl)
    resolved PRECISE through idOf's vars fallback → a RAW fixed-slot load at
    the foreign layout: no guard, no dyn fallback, wrong VALUES at EVERY
    optimize level incl. O0, the reference tier (probe-collide: for-of and
    param collisions returned 10 for 12, natively). The three kernel episodes
    were all this: a new/reordered literal in a pass shifted which schema
    'site' resolved to inside rest-spec's OWN compiled body — slot-debug
    showed [slot:precise] site.callee → the colliding literal's sid, slot 3
    (canonical callSites lays callee at slot 0); kernel WAT dump of
    $specializeFixedRestCalls confirmed the bare `f64.load offset=24` →
    map.get(wrong value) missed → the pass silently no-oped → "expected
    fixed-arity rest clone". Diagnosis: a semantically-neutral key REORDER of
    the site literal re-broke the kernel leg alone; slotOf arm instrumentation
    (JZ_DBG_SLOT) fingered idOf's vars fallback, not any structural arm.
    FIX (prepare's binding census): EVERY binding form censuses its bare
    name — decls (literal → sid; non-literal/no-init/unknown-spread → unknown;
    for-of/for-in/catch arrive as lowered decls), lifted-func name + params,
    closure params, destructure targets (raw + module-prefixed). A name with
    ≥2 sites that aren't all same-sid literal decls is BARRED:
    ctx.schema.varsBarred + vars.delete, order-insensitive, barred never
    (re)binds — gates bindDeclSchema (the new consensus setter replacing
    prepDecl's and defFunc-default's UNCONDITIONAL vars.set), bindAssignSchema,
    and plan/scope's refineFieldProvenance. Unlike poison, barring gates ONLY
    the vars channel: per-function ValueReps keep their per-body provenance
    and devirt (pinned: own-function reads stay exact; a unique-bound literal
    keeps its slot-resolved WAT). Single-binding names behave exactly as
    before; `let x; x = {…}` keeps the assignment-consensus path.
    CONSEQUENCES: the SCHEMA-IDENTITY CONTRACT IS RETIRED (audit kill-list #1;
    narrow.js comment rewritten — shape-matching is schema-table hygiene now,
    not a correctness rule); object literals are safe to introduce anywhere.
    test/mem.js run() switched to interop's instantiate: exported
    unproven-receiver reads that previously rode the leak now correctly take
    the guarded/dyn path (which declares env imports — the raw
    WebAssembly.instantiate had been relying on the unsound binding; the mem
    API's own "unknown schema marshals as hash" contract REQUIRES the dyn
    path, so the leak also broke that composition). KNOWN REMAINING SIBLING
    (ledgered, narrow): a single `let x = f()` decl followed by `x = {A}`
    assignment binds A via assignment consensus while reads before the
    reassignment see f()'s value — the decl-initializer is not an assignment
    event; entangled with refineFieldProvenance's const-provenance channel,
    deferred. BATTERY: native 3020/0, slot-hazards 16/16 (4 new collision
    pins), kernel 1139/0 (canonical literal restored), O0/O3/wasi 3024/0 ×3,
    bench 207/208 (only the standing shapes red; focused wasmtime rows stable
    1.65–1.68 vs AS 1.50 ≈ 1.10× — carrier untouched, jz binary 3.3 kB
    unchanged), selfhost 21/21 + warm 0.971× / fresh 0.709× (both inside
    caps; warm IMPROVED from 0.980×), fuzz 5000 zero-divergence.
    dist/jz.wasm 11560→11789 kB (+2%): the kernel loses the unsound
    cross-function devirt its own colliding names enjoyed — honest cost.
  * BYTE-STRIDE CARRIER + QOI FOLD + SHAPES HONESTY CORRECTION (2026-07-19b):
    (1) BYTE-STRIDE 20 B UNION RECORDS LANDED (audit layout item): union
        arrays now pack elements at stride·4 bytes with NO pad cell (stride 5
        → 20 B, was 24). Header len stays PHYSICAL 8-byte cells (⌈n·s/8⌉ —
        alloc/grow untouched); logical count = ⌊len·8/s⌋, EXACT for every
        stride ≥ 2 (ceil(x) − x < 1 < s/8·… proof at the [] arm). Three
        sites: [] elemAddr (base + i·strideB — one mul, SIMPLER than the
        cell mul+shl), length read, push (stride lanes + byte cursor +
        ceil-cell header; init-only cost). Pins 17/17 + the 12-B stride
        ratchet assertion; checksums exact. PERF: NEUTRAL on shapes by
        paired A/B (records are L2-resident + prefetched — the pad lane
        cost no time); kept as the honest FOOTPRINT win (−17%/record) +
        simpler hot-path math.
    (2) QOI extend8_s LANDED (watr 5.7.10, published + jz dep bumped):
        strength fold `(x<<K)>>K → i32.extend{8,16}_s` — qoi's 6 recorded
        sites mint, zero shift-pairs left; A/B neutral-to-positive
        (2/3 pairs favor, checksums exact); sound + smaller, keep. Pinned
        in watr (278/0) incl. mismatched-shift negative.
    (3) SHAPES CLAIM CORRECTED (own measurement error): the earlier
        "steady-state parity" compared jz's warm 3rd-main against AS's
        HARNESS number — apples-oranges. Clean alternated FOCUSED pairs
        (both runners, no in-loop compiles, 6 rounds): AS ~950-965 µs,
        jz ~1100-1165 → ratio ≈ 1.13-1.15 STABLE, warm included. The
        full-harness paired protocol is additionally contaminated for jz's
        row by its own in-process compile heat (jz 1.13-1.51 swings; AS
        stable) — the alternated-focused form is the canonical Q3 protocol.
        A/B EXHAUSTED at op level: inline beats call (1.13 vs 1.70 with
        the raw-i32 clone callee), 20B ≈ 24B, census ≤ AS. The ~0.8
        cy/record residual is V8-codegen-level (regalloc/scheduling of the
        fused loop) — next lever = machine-code profiling (Instruments/
        xctrace or a V8 debug build), recorded as the frontier. shapes
        stays RED under the absolute band at ≈1.14×.
  * KERNEL-FRAGILITY EPISODE 3 — SCHEMA-IDENTITY CONTRACT (2026-07-19): the
    clone-pass batch broke the kernel leg (rest-clone WAT + rest-sum parity)
    by PRESENCE ALONE — the pass never executed in-kernel (unionInline off
    at the kernel's optimize:false) yet its compilation in corrupted the
    kernel's own rest specialization. FOUR-STEP BISECT (each dist rebuild +
    filtered kernel run): PASS_NAMES revert → still red (+OOB morph when
    the union verifier re-ran in-kernel); coerceArg + ladder revert → still
    red (both exonerated); clone-pass STUB → GREEN 86/86; kernel-safe STYLE
    rewrite (plain loops, manual Map copies) → still red — style wasn't it.
    MECHANISM (confirmed by the fix): the pass introduced NEW OBJECT-LITERAL
    SCHEMAS — a 3-key site `{ argList, node, callerSig }` and a 3-key param
    `{ name, type, ptrKind }` — whose props collide at DIFFERENT SLOTS with
    existing shapes (program-facts' 4-key `{ callee, argList, callerFunc,
    node }` site; bimorphic's 4-key param). The schema-table shift trips the
    RECORDED OPEN unguarded-unique-prop structural-resolution hole INSIDE
    the kernel's own compiled passes: rest-spec's `site.argList`/`site.node`
    reads mis-resolved. FIX (the slotOf-not-find contract pattern): new
    literals in compiler source must be SHAPE-IDENTICAL (same keys, same
    order) to the existing schema they conceptually share — sites now build
    `{ callee, argList, callerFunc, node }` (callerFunc carries the func;
    .sig read at use), params `{ name, type, ptrKind, ptrAux: null }`.
    Kernel 86/86 with the FULL pass present; pins 17/17. THE ROOT CAUSE is
    the open unique-prop hole — PROMOTED to the next correctness hunt with
    this episode as its third live manifestation (probe-min2.mjs is the
    minimal repro; the guarded/dyn fix is the recorded remedy). The kernel
    leg is the standing pin for the class (native legs structurally cannot
    catch kernel-only schema-shift corruption).
  * AUDIT R2 QUESTIONS ANSWERED (2026-07-18f, all three adopted):
    (Q1) THE 5% BAND IS ABSOLUTE — "statistical parity" never satisfies the
        gate; it only classifies. The fairness concern moves to Q3 (measure
        correctly rather than weaken the criterion). shapes stays RED until
        a paired-median verdict lands inside 1.05× of AS.
    (Q2) LANDED — optimize false/0/1 is now the REPRESENTATION-FREE
        REFERENCE TIER: structInline + unionInline registered as first-class
        PASS_NAMES (kills the audit's hidden-flags item too) with ALL_OFF
        defaults at 0/1 and ALL_ON at 2+/speed/size;
        `{ level: 0, unionInline: true }` re-enables explicitly. The fuzz
        matrix {0,1,2,3} is now automatically a reference-vs-representation
        differential on every seed. O0/kernel legs re-gated (battery).
    (Q3) ADOPTED AS POLICY — release verdicts use PAIRED, order-aware
        measurement: per-run jz/AS ratios from the same harness invocation
        (never cross-run absolutes), ≥4 repetitions, medians of ratios;
        full-table single-pass runs are demoted to smoke evidence (the
        11-fail full run vs green focused reruns proved the instability).
        Harness `--paired` mode is the recorded follow-up.
  * RE-AUDIT ROUND 2 RESPONSE (2026-07-18e): the second audit CONFIRMED the
    prior fixes (carrier fail-closed cases, chainTable gate, reference mode,
    clone direction) and found ONE new deterministic miscompile:
    cseScalarLoad CROSS-ARM ANCHOR REUSE — the pass cleared its table at
    if-entry but walked ALL children with ONE shared table, so a load
    CSE'd in the then-arm anchored a $__cs local the ELSE-arm then read
    (unset on that path; fires at O2+ on f64 slot loads — the union
    carrier masks it on int records, floats expose it: repro 358296 vs
    224288). FIX: per-arm table isolation (each then/else clears on
    entry — sibling arms are exclusive paths, no dominance). Sibling
    sweep: the pure-binop CSE twin was already DELETED in the ablation
    sweep (orphaned doc comment); cse-load.js is sound (per-';'-sequence
    tables, control flushes; ternary cross-arm merge hoists a pure-index
    CHECKED read — no trap, value-exact). PIN: test/optimizer.js
    first-iteration-else float differential (201/201). AUDIT'S CLONE
    FINDING WAS STALE: it measured the tree BEFORE the fresh-site-
    collection fix landed in the working tree — the clone now receives
    calls (pin asserts clone presence at watr:false, where jz's own DCE
    would drop an uncalled clone; probe shows call sites rewritten).
    LEDGER CORRECTIONS per kill-list: 20 B/record claim → 24 B (⌈5/2⌉
    8-byte cells, one pad lane; exact 20 B = byte-stride follow-up).
    "Statistical parity" LANGUAGE: retained as a classification ONLY —
    the hard 5% per-case band stays RED on shapes until the user answers
    audit Q1 (parity-overrides-band); the V1 checkbox stays open.
    AUDIT'S NEW QUESTIONS (user's to answer): (1) is the 5% band absolute
    or may parity override; (2) should optimize:false imply
    unionInline:false by default; (3) must release measurements be
    paired/order-alternated (11-fail full run vs green focused reruns —
    harness instability is real).
  * CARRIER-SPECIALIZED CLONES LANDED (2026-07-18d — audit decision 2
    implemented): specializeUnionCursorParams (narrow.js, mirrors
    specializeBimorphicTyped's construction rules) — a function whose params
    are VERIFIED union cursors gets a `$union` sibling with RAW I32
    cell-address params (type 'i32', ptrKind OBJECT); the clone body rides
    the EXISTING stage-2 local-cursor emit path with ZERO new emit
    machinery: `$measure$union (param $o i32)` emits `i32.load($o)` /
    `i32.load($o+4)` — the AssemblyScript-exact shape, ZERO unbox, ZERO
    NaN-box crossing the call (pinned: zero i64.reinterpret in the clone).
    Sanctioned callsites rewrite to the clone; the f64 original remains as
    the generic fallback (treeshakes when uncalled). coerceArg gained the
    OBJECT inline offset extraction (PTR.OBJECT never forwards — no
    __ptr_offset call for OBJECT-kind pointer args, benefits all pointer-ABI
    OBJECT params). TWO integration bugs root-caused en route: (1) the clone
    needs its OWN analyzeFuncForEmit run (facts derive under ITS sig — the
    pointer-ABI registration lives there; sharing the original's f64-sig
    facts emitted numeric coercions of the address); (2) programFacts.
    callSites are STALE at the emit gateway — plan's loop rewrites clone
    body nodes, so the early site refs silently no-op'd the rewrite (worked
    at O0, masked at speed by watr's box∘unbox folds); the pass now
    collects sites FRESH over the current AST. Steady-state A/B: clone
    ≥ pre-clone (~4% on a thermal-degraded machine); kernel census leanest
    yet (24 i32.load, 48 local.get, zero box ops). Retirement of the f64
    fallback machinery (hoistUnionCursorUnbox, readVar f64 tag,
    emitPropAccess cellI32 trigger) deferred until the fallback proves dead
    across the corpus. Quiet strict-win re-verdict owed (machine ~40%
    thermal-degraded at measurement time).
  * AUDIT DECISIONS ADOPTED (2026-07-18c, all five answered):
    (1) REFERENCE MODE: LANDED — `optimize: { unionInline: false }` (and
        structInline twin) disable the representation wholesale; three-way
        differential pins (off / on / plain JS) in struct-inline. Follow-up:
        wire the flag into the fuzz matrix as a fourth leg.
    (2) CARRIER-SPECIALIZED CLONES: YES — the next major unit (design
        below). Kills the NaN-box seam, hoistUnionCursorUnbox, and the
        all-or-nothing black on mixed callsites; the credible path to the
        shapes strict win.
    (3) "FASTEST WASM" = V8 headline + WASMTIME NO-REGRESSION column (the
        chainTable episode proved substrate-sensitive reversals exist;
        jz-wasmtime rides the bench already — the rule makes it a gate).
    (4) NATIVE GATE = STOCK wasm2c → clang -O3 (reproducible; measures the
        compiler's output, not pipeline heroics). Current: shapes ~12%
        behind native C through stock w2c.
    (5) WIP-ON-MAIN: allowed ONLY with fail-closed verification +
        adversarial pins (the bracket/alias/escape/forward/capture/shadow
        template) in the SAME commit — the standing rule.
    CLONE UNIT DESIGN (the decision-2 implementation sketch, entry points
    verified this session): for each function with VERIFIED cursor-params
    (inlineUnionCursors post-verification), emit a sibling
    `$name$union` whose cursor params are RAW I32 cell addresses
    (p.type='i32', rep ptrKind=OBJECT + cursor registration → the
    EXISTING local-cursor read path emits packed loads with zero unbox);
    sanctioned callsites (the `()` handler's elem-cursor agreement)
    call the clone with the raw address (no NaN-box); generic/host
    callsites keep the f64 original. Mixed callsites then STOP blacking
    the union (today's all-or-nothing lifts). Precedent machinery:
    speculateTypedParams + emitSpeculativeCall (provenance leg 2) and
    synthesizeBoundaryWrappers (sig-cloning emit). Retire
    hoistUnionCursorUnbox + the readVar f64-param tag once landed.
  * RE-AUDIT RESPONSE — SAFETY PATCH LANDED (2026-07-18b): the external
    re-audit found a REAL cross-function miscompile class (confirmed by
    repro): a cursor-param body using NON-GRAMMAR reads — `o['x']` bracket
    (wrong values), `const q = o` alias (OOB trap), `helper(o)` forward
    (OOB at O0) — because stage-3 registration trusted schemaIdSet equality
    as carrier provenance WITHOUT verifying the callee body. ROOT CAUSE was
    structural: `if (!uArr.size) continue` skipped callee bodies (no union
    arrays of their own) from the verify walk entirely. FIX (fail-closed,
    one shared verdict): candidate cursor-params are SEEDED into the same
    per-function `cursor` map, so the ONE existing grammar walk covers
    them — bracket/alias/write/escape/forward/closure-capture all hit the
    existing black rules, and a violation BLACKS the union key program-
    wide (the caller then never packs — correctness on both sides). The
    unsound finale param-registration block is DELETED (audit kill-list
    #1); params now register through the same verified keep-filter as
    local cursors. The verifier ALSO gained the terminator-ladder suffix
    narrowing (mirrors emitBlockBody via its own elseRefs — without it the
    canonical trailing-fallback read failed closed and deactivated the
    real bench). PINS: +5-case audit-class batch (bracket, alias, ret_obj,
    capture, forward — value-exact at O0+speed; 17/17 struct-inline).
    Shapes carrier intact after the patch: 3370 B, checksum exact.
    AUDIT TRIAGE: perf section STALE (measured pre-cost-gate watr; the
    br_table regression was independently found + fixed with the
    chainTable cost gate, landed watr 5.7.9 with pins — audit kill-list
    #6 done better than asked). DEFERRED (recorded, real): StorageRep/
    carrier-provenance as first-class facts split from schemaSet;
    carrier-specialized function variants (measure$union — kills the
    NaN-box seam + hoistUnionCursorUnbox); 20-byte byte-stride records
    (current cells pad to 24 B); consolidating the 4 discriminant-
    refinement implementations; unionInline:false reference mode;
    final-substrate control-shape corpus; pass manager/MIR architecture.
    OPEN DECISIONS (the audit's questions, user's to answer): O0-as-
    reference semantics; internal fn cloning for carriers; V8-only vs
    wasmtime-competitive "fastest wasm"; stock wasm2c as the native gate;
    WIP-on-main policy.
  * UNION CARRIER STAGES 3+4 — COMPLETE, GATED (2026-07-18): shapes' cross-
    call packed carrier LANDED end to end. measure(rows[i]) reads its cursor
    param through the packed cells: ONE entry unbox, raw `i32.load offset=`
    fields, all-i32 discriminant ladder, ZERO dynamic reads; watr then
    inlines measure into runKernel (kernel census: 43 i32.load, 0 f64 ops,
    12 reinterpret). Checksum 2400445253 EXACT (O0 + speed, differential vs
    V8 on the same source). Module 13.7 → 3.37 kB. GATE (full, on the final
    tree): native/O0/O3/wasi 3019/0 ×4, kernel leg 1139/0, selfhost 21/0,
    fuzz 5000 clean. FIVE whole-class pieces:
    (1) EMIT CARRIER: emitPropAccess's f64→i32 base rebuild fires on
        `va.cellI32` and carries cellI32/unionKey through — the packed
        branch in emitSchemaSlotRead sees the tag (the WIP's lost-tag bug).
    (2) TERMINATOR ELSE-IF LADDER NARROWING (emitBlockBody): early-return
        refinement generalized from `if (c) return` (no else) to full
        terminator ladders — control past the statement implies ¬cN for
        every level whose then-arm terminates, up to the first non-
        terminator arm; exclusion facts STACK level by level so the
        trailing fallback narrows to the singleton member (killed measure's
        last 3 __dyn_get in the k===7 tail). Tail-reassignment guarded.
    (3) i32 DISCRIMINANT LOCAL: slotI32CertainAt/slotIntCertainAt grew the
        closed-union rep channel (mirrors slotOf's) — `const k = o.k` plans
        an i32 local via exprType; the ladder compares i32 (7 f64.convert +
        7 f64.eq → 0). Resolves in index.js's existing strict-slot locals
        re-derivation (post-settlement — no cache hazard).
    (4) ENTRY UNBOX HOIST (hoistUnionCursorUnbox, sibling of
        hoistInvariantParamCoercions): per-read wrap(reinterpret($o))
        chains strip to one entry i32 local — one unbox per record after
        inlining instead of per field (34 reinterpret + 24 wrap → 12 + 2).
    (5) SPECULATION SKIP: a sanctioned union cursor reads under
        discriminant PROOFS — emitBranch's schema speculation cloned the
        body into two identical packed arms behind a redundant tag guard;
        skipped for registered cursors (3.8 → 3.37 kB).
    SOUNDNESS HOLES CLOSED (own review): (a) cursor-param registration
    fails closed on body reassignment (stale cellI32 tags + stale hoisted
    cell otherwise); (b) the readVar param tag does NOT stamp ptrKind on
    the f64 node — ptrKind on an f64-typed node makes asF64/asI64 box it
    as a raw i32 offset (the documented f64-global hazard); tag is
    cellI32/unionKey only, and the untagged fallback stays value-correct
    through __ptr_offset. PINS: struct-inline +2 (16/16) — full cross-call
    shape (JS-exact O0+speed, zero dyn, all-i32 ladder, `(local $k i32)`,
    single entry unbox) and reassigned-cursor-param fail-closed. AS ground
    truth (wasm2wat on the bench artifact): AS does NOT inline measure and
    does NOT br_table — call-per-record with a raw i32 receiver param;
    jz's kernel now matches that shape minus the sig carrier and watr
    additionally inlines. Bench: loaded-machine first read 1.42 ms (from
    1.86–1.92) BEFORE pieces (3)-(5); quiet verdict below.
    REGRESSION CAUGHT + FIXED (same session, watr-side): the first quiet
    bench read 4.59 ms — WORSE than stage-2, and O0 BEAT the speed build.
    Mid-flight probe numbers (1363→6510µs right after piece 3) had been
    dismissed as machine load — WRONG; own the miss. ROOT CAUSE: with the
    ladder in i32 (piece 3), watr's chainTable pass converted it to a
    br_table — one indirect branch that MISPREDICTS per record on the
    data-shuffled stream (~15-20 cy), where the compare chain is 7 biased
    (~87.5%) individually-predictable branches (~0.5 mispredict/record).
    Its seltree dual (built for exactly this) could not rescue: the arms
    load memory — unspeculable. FIX (watr optimize.js): chainTable cost
    gate — every arm LIGHT (no store/call/nested control, ≤48 tokens) AND
    some arm LOADS ⇒ keep the chain (the tagged-union record-dispatch
    regime); all-pure light arms still table→seltree (branchless, best);
    heavy arms (stores/calls — the interpreter regime) keep the table. vm
    KEEPS its br_table (5.90 ms, ~2× ahead of AS 11.28) and dispatch LEADS
    ALL incl. native C (4.51 vs 4.78). PLUS a second watr fold:
    wrap∘or(hiC_low-zero) — the NaN-box pointer BOX at watr-inline joins
    now unwinds completely (kernel: i64.or 0, i64.extend 0; propagate +
    ROUNDTRIP + this compose bottom-up); i64 consts compared as canonical
    hex STRINGS (self-host contract, no BigInt). watr suites 276/0 +
    591/0, jz ratchet 6/6. Shapes after: 1092 µs scratch / 1.21 ms noisy
    harness vs AS 0.99-1.10 — statistical AS parity, quiet verdict below.
    watr changes need a PUBLISH (user-gated) before jz CI benches see them
    — local node_modules/watr is a symlink to the watr repo.
    QUIET VERDICT (2026-07-18, landed 800c70ab jz + 03e686e watr): shapes
    jz → V8 1.15–1.23 ms / wasmtime 1.11–1.17 vs AS 0.99–1.10 across five
    quiet runs — SECOND WASM by median (~1.1×, from 1.7×), ahead of every
    native row (C 1.25-1.96, Rust 1.26-1.81, Zig var). STEADY-STATE proof:
    three sequential main() in one process → 1223/1118/1101 µs — the
    fully-warm kernel is INSIDE AS's band; the harness's single-main
    protocol carries the warm-up (both modules pay the same rules; V8
    warms AS's smaller module faster). Op census: jz does FEWER per-record
    ops than AS (no call, no rows[i] pointer indirection, same select-
    based abs, same biased i32 ladder) — no structural slop remains; the
    A/B disproved de-inlining (1813 vs 1155 µs). CLASSIFICATION: AS
    statistical parity (the ulam/raymarcher category), not a strict median
    win. Resumable strict-win lever: V8 profile (Instruments) of the
    ~0.5 cy/record residual; op-level levers are exhausted. Blast-radius
    spot-checks all green with checksums exact: vm 5.90 (keeps br_table,
    ~2× ahead of AS), dispatch LEADS ALL incl. native C, raytrace 1.04
    LEADS ALL, fft 1.04 LEADS ALL, qoi 7.70 beats AS 8.56 (1.23× rust).
  * UNION CARRIER STAGE 3 — ANALYSIS DONE, EMIT REMAINS (2026-07-18;
    WIP saved scratchpad/stage3-wip.patch, 102 lines; tree reverted to the
    green stage-2 state because the emit half traps). The ANALYSIS side is
    COMPLETE and verified: on the REAL shapes bench the union now REGISTERS
    (`eligible: 0..7, black: []`) — three fixes made it: (1) the verifier
    sanctions an element-cursor crossing `measure(rows[i])` when the callee
    param's settled schemaIdSet equals the union key AND the index is a
    proven bounded pair (analyzeUnionInline `()` handler); (2) a union array
    born from a user CALL whose return arrayElemSchemaSet is the key
    (`const rows = initRows()`) or an alias is sanctioned at the decl rule
    (was poisoned — only `[]` was allowed); (3) union-CELL params (rep
    schemaIdSet ∈ registry) register into inlineUnionCursors at the finale.
    The multi-hop propagation VERIFIED end to end: initRows return
    arrayElemSchemaSet 0..7 → main local → runKernel param arrayElemSchemaSet
    → measure param schemaIdSet 0..7 (runArrSetFixpoint + runSchemaIdSetFix-
    point, both landed). EMIT is the remainder: measure's `o.field` reads
    still emit `f64.load` (heap-object carrier), not packed `i32.load` — the
    boxed-f64 param's cellI32 tag from readVar (relaxed to fire without
    ptrKind in the WIP) is LOST before core.js's emitSchemaSlotRead packed
    branch (baseExpr.cellI32 unset at the slot read; emit(o) in the prop-
    access path likely re-coerces through asF64 and drops the expando, or
    slotOf's base isn't the tagged node). FIX LOCUS: the emitPropAccess →
    emitSchemaSlotRead chain for a boxed-f64 union-cursor param base —
    thread cellI32/unionKey to the slot read, unbox the NaN-boxed cell to its
    i32 address, packedI32.load. Then: 2-3 residual __dyn_get to clear, the
    checksum differential (2400445253), and HARD gating (touches narrow +
    the closure/param ABI — the self-host-fragile area that caused the
    07-18 CI red, so full kernel leg + fuzz are mandatory before landing).
  * UNION CARRIER STATE (2026-07-17, session tail): stage 1 (fail-closed
    verifier + registries) COMMITTED; stage 2 (the carrier: []/push/length
    arms, packed-cell reads via the refinement chain, flow-types' negative-
    sense EXCLUSION twin — the else-ladder narrows member sets level by
    level) WORKS: one-function shapes variant JS-EXACT with ZERO dynamic
    reads and raw i32.load offset= fields; pins struct-inline 15 assertions
    incl. exported-return fail-closed. Suite 3018/0 + fuzz clean; warm gate
    straddles 0.99 under load (0.965–0.992) — re-judge quiet before the
    stage-2 commit. STAGE 3 (the real bench row's missing link) — cursor
    crosses `measure(rows[i])`: narrow's pointer-ABI param spec extends to
    union cursors (arg = elem-of-union-array at EVERY site + callee param
    rep carries schemaIdSet ⇒ param.type = i32 cell address, reads inside
    the callee resolve via the SAME refinement chain; the verifier's
    cursor-as-arg poison lifts only under that agreement; address validity
    = no grow between arg computation and the call's last read — callee
    must not push/grow ANY union array reachable from args, verifier-
    checked). FOLLOW-UP (craft, audit-dedup theme): the exclusion lattice
    now lives ×3 (program-facts census / analyze verifier / flow-types
    emitter) — extract one shared discriminant-lattice module.
  * PRIOR VERDICT 2026-07-15 — OPEN. The last completed
    `npm run test:bench` passed 204/208 and exposed four fastest-WASM losses:
    fft, QOI, raytrace, and shapes. The string-representation unswitch keeps
    tokenizer closed even under that loaded frontier.
    The follow-up mechanism batch adds call-free pure eager booleans,
    transitive typed-parameter distinctness, tiny strided-loop specialization,
    internal SIMD-helper inlining, and watr 5.7.8's conservative branch-loop ×2
    unroll. The audit rejected a histogram/prefix/scatter theorem after its ~4%
    radix gain destabilized the stricter self-host gate, retained the underlying
    nested checked-index correctness fix, and unswitched decomposed
    strings' trap-safe SSO/heap choice outside leaf scans. Repeated focused
    evidence has wordcount as an outright win; radixsort remains
    inside the hard 5% band (jz 2.34–2.40ms vs rust 2.29–2.30ms),
    and tokenizer (jz 43–48µs vs AS 51–55µs) as wins. A whole-chain exact-SID
    dispatch moved shapes only ~3% and was rejected after it broke the strict
    warm self-host gate; AS remains ~1.00–1.05ms. The open
    frontier is shapes, load-sensitive QOI (focused jz 7.6–9.4ms vs rust
    7.5–8.1), raytrace (focused jz 1.14–1.32ms vs rust 0.97–1.00), and
    borderline FFT (latest loaded ratio 1.060×). Each remains an explicit
    `WASM_TODO`. `examples/bench.mjs` is 1.60× geomean and 13/14 wins;
    raymarcher remains ~0.84–0.92× V8. Therefore the V1 performance gate is not
    closed and `bench/results.json` must not be presented as current proof
    until a clean release snapshot is regenerated.
  * STATE 2026-07-14 (lever grind, sessions 3-4): DONE & ARCHIVED — strbuild
    WON (itoa-at-cursor −51.5%; jz 0.46ms leads every string-producing rival,

    Root F CLOSED — MERGED 2026-07-14 (89ca3b8e..dc2934b7, 21 commits):
    checked-by-default typed indexing — runtime-variable OOB reads →
    undefined, writes ignored (JS-exact) instead of silent adjacent-heap
    corruption, at bench parity (conv2d 1.010, fft 1.024, aos 0.997,
    colorconv 1.000, blur 1.001, cs exact) and +0.1% corpus size. Battery
    on the rebase (== merged main): suite 2917/0, selfhost 21/21, fuzz
    2000/0. Detail in the MERGED archive section below. "Shapes tag-switch
    devirt" was a STALE ROW — already landed 07-07 (2159fa64

    V8 12.25 beaten 1.75×. Dispatch RESIDUAL closed 2026-07-14 (watr
    f0e6499): intguard whole-temp collapse — every use of a single-tee'd
    convert temp being a guard/trunc rewrites atomically to one fresh i32
    tee + gets (the per-site count gate rightly refused; merge/coalesce
    then poisoned the temps — this resolves in the round the shape is
    born). Arms fully RAW; another −7.8% (cum −36%). Fuzz seed 794 caught
    a param-fact hole (a param's one write is NOT single-def — pre-write
    reads see the caller's fractional value) — params excluded from every
    single-def fact, pinned. Quiet-machine final: dispatch jz 4.37 vs JSC
    2.39 (1.83× from 2.97×), V8 8.56 beaten 1.96×; residual = the tree's
    structural floor (all 8 arms + 7 selects vs JSC's profiled JIT).
    NOTE the guard-only collapse counter-result stands: −350 B but +9%,
    predicted cmov beats trunc serialization — leaner ≠ faster; the win
    was killing convert∘trunc∘guard TOGETHER. 2026-07-14 standings:
    immutable WON (0.50 leads V8 0.63 + JSC 0.91), shapes WON (782860e3
    devirt duplicate-read memo, −5.7% — quiet-machine 2.85 leads V8 3.42

    gate caught it). wordcount 1.09× behind V8 (from 1.5×; beats JSC
    2.97): collections fwd-inline landed (d43a98b5) — probe openings
    inline box→offset, the cap load IS the forward check (-1 sentinel →
    cold __ptr_offset_fwd), the per-probe __ptr_offset call (23.5% self)
    gone from every hash/map/set probe/upsert, −8% interleaved cs exact;
    profile now one flat probe kernel (~85% self: inline hash + walk +
    guards vs V8 dictionary ICs) — remaining row open, structural.

    installs watr from npm. Remaining owners: sort = bounds-PROOF
    (heapsort's `child<n` with n=a.length dominates every read —
    length-identity + non-neg range facts at -Os, no twins needed);
    wav/base64 = store-guard density (44-byte RIFF header = ~24 guarded
    const-index stores; writeU32 helper is 4 guarded stores ≈ 90 B vs AS
    28 B) + the both-sides-checked f64.ne verify loops (i32-narrowing
    those is UNSOUND: undef!==undef is false, f64.ne(NaN,NaN) true —
    needs proofs, not narrowing). Also found+fixed: watr's fuzz-794
    param pin had a missing close-paren and NEVER RAN (test/optimize.js
    'Unclosed parenthesis' was pre-existing at HEAD, masked in npm-test
    tail). Tried-and-reverted stands: $__typed_idx call route (+900 B),
    sourceInline:false, guard-only collapse (+9%). Parked rows stand:
    immutable (SROA/escape), nqueens/raytrace/qoi/dict (LLVM-class).
    2026-07-14 EPYC ARC (user CI finding — live site publishing losses):
    wordcount/immutable/shapes flipped to 0.75/0.69/0.58 on the EPYC CI
    runner while the SAME builds lead on M4 (today-engine M4: 1.03/1.32-
    lead/1.35-lead — todo claims reproduce exactly). bench-probe workflow
    ADDED (aa9a2892, workflow_dispatch, repeated rounds): runner is
    STABLE ±2% over 5 rounds — systematic µarch, NOT noise (same rounds:
    dispatch leads 2.43×, hash 1.19×). jz degrades 1.3-1.9× MORE than V8
    on the machine change (immutable 4.4× vs 2.3×). M4 profile: wordcount
    = $__hash_slot 79.7% self — the open-addressing probe (24 B entries,
    linear probe, byte-verify via __str_eq; V8's x64 Map = SwissTable-
    style SIMD group probing in C++). OWNER: probe-kernel µarch work —
    control-byte/group probing or entry-layout change + wordized verify
    (i64-chunk memcmp) + possibly load-factor drop; test on M4 (must not
    regress) then bench-probe on EPYC decides. Share-passes variant ruled
    OUT (outline/tailmerge −3.5% bytes only, ±1% time — not I-cache from
    duplication). bench snapshot-publish RACE fixed (28fdc748): two waves
    rebase-conflicted on generated bench.svg — `-X theirs` + retry loop.
    2026-07-14 KERNEL-LEG BISECT (per-file, timeout-fenced): the 7 h
    "grind" was an INFINITE LOOP in one wasm call (sample: all frames in
    one JSToWasm call). Verdict map: HANGS errors/generators/parser-bugs/
    transform (420 s fence); module-resolver-class fails (destruct/
    closures/inference — Unknown module, need onKernel guards);
    optimizer-shape-class (simd/optimizer/never-grown/slot-hazards — the
    kernel runs optimize:false, shape asserts need guards); REAL kernel
    bugs: bigint mixed-op TypeError paths, string OOB index, JSON.parse
    memory OOB, Object.assign unknown-schema, speculate plan-field,
    preeval rational-carry, pow-fold OOB. Feeds the selfhost-workflow
    fix; scratchpad/kernel-bisect.mjs is the harness.
    2026-07-14/15 SIZE ARC CLOSED — FOUR WINS + TIE, CI-GREEN: typedLen
    param channel (df1a9600) + watr 5.5.0 intguard family → -Os vs asc
    -Oz: hash 1164 (0.851), wav 1721 (0.983), base64 1924 (0.9995 — win
    by ONE byte, watch it), aos 1913 (0.977), sort 1941 (1.027 TIE).
    sort's last 51 B + medianUs proofs = S2 WHILE-BODY FIXPOINT in
    scanIntervalIdx (2-round widening, cond refinement incl && descent,
    record-on-stable-pass; S1 downward-for LANDED) — the named owner.
    2026-07-15 RFFT ARC (V8 got faster in node 25.9; row was 0.83/0.72):
    (1) watr 5.6.0 unclamp (speed profile) — surviving select-clamped
    checked reads → if-forms; transform's 82 clamp selects → 10;
    interleaved +15.4% rfft / +12.3% cepstrum. (2) versioning-guard
    OFF-BY-ONE: maxIv used the EXCLUSIVE bound so `maxIv < len` failed
    exactly when len == bound — every half-spectrum/tail-increment while
    (cepstrum log fill, medianUs) silently ran the CHECKED arm forever;
    maxIv is now the true pre-increment max, only genuinely
    post-increment accesses widen (cand.post; bodies are ';'-sequences
    not '{}' — the position scan handles both). (3) mirror-lane v128
    store in tryVectorize (`inp[N−k]` = contiguous DESCENDING → one
    v128.store at N−k−1 with swapped f64 lanes) — unlocks log_v on
    symmetric fills. (4) spans, not bounds: `bound & -lanes` assumed a
    0 entry — a k=1 loop ran its last vector step one lane PAST the
    bound (caught by the odd-tail pin; masked in rfft only because the
    source overwrites the Nyquist bin) — ×3 recognizers now align
    iv + ((bound−iv) & -lanes). NET: rfft 0.83→0.95×, cepstrum
    0.72→1.05× BEATS V8, unit interleaved 1.52×, bit-exact. Pins:
    optimizer.js ×3 (mirror guard, len==bound fast arm, downward-for),
    simd.js ×1 (log_v + swapped shuffle + odd-tail parity).
    TRIED-AND-REJECTED: hash-table load factor 75→62.5% (one-line grow
    threshold) — wordcount −5.4% on M4, immutable/shapes neutral; bigger
    tables cost more than shorter probes buy. EPYC owner unchanged:
    group probing (SwissTable-style control bytes + v128 group scan) +
    wordized verify in genSlotUpsert — bench-probe workflow is the
    EPYC-side verdict instrument.
    2026-07-15 MISCOMPILE FAMILY (found by S2 probes, ALL SHIPPED at every
    opt level, 20/20 probe battery now green): (1) ABRUPT-EDGE EXIT STATES —
    the interval walk published fall-through-only exit states; a `break`
    (also labeled, do/for-of, switch-select, try-throw) reaches the exit
    with a mid-body state → post-loop `a[x]` emitted RAW → trap/wrong-value.
    Fix: loop frames snapshot env at break/continue, exits/back-edges hull
    them in; kill-class constructs (do/for-of/for-in/label/switch/try +
    the LOWERED 'catch'/'finally' the walk actually receives) walk each
    child from the killed entry state and exit at it. (2) watr deadset was
    try_table-BLIND (straight-line scan reached the killer store through
    the call→catch edge; `x=1e6; try{throw; x=0}catch; get x` returned 0)
    — 5.6.1 published: catch continuations must prove 'set' at try entry
    AND for candidates inside; throw/throw_ref/rethrow are terminal.
    (3) SENTINEL→NaN: checked f64 reads yield the UNDEF sentinel in the
    miss arm; hardware NaN propagation carries the PAYLOAD through
    f64 arithmetic to the boundary → `s + a[OOB]` decoded as undefined
    (JS: NaN). Fix at the producer/consumer seam: `.typed:[]` tags
    checkedNumRead; toNumF64 folds the miss arm statically (undefined→
    canonical nan, BEFORE the valTypeOf NUMBER fast-out, which claims the
    element type and is blind to the OOB path) — zero hot-path cost;
    f64 typed stores route the RHS through toNumF64 (spec ToNumber;
    provably-numeric RHS byte-identical); scalarized f64 slots coerce via
    `u+`; uninit `let` flags maybeNullish UNLESS firstRefKind proves the
    first evaluation-order ref is an unconditional write (both-arm if/
    ternary joins count — ast.js firstRefKind; the blanket flag broke the
    mandelbrot escape recognizer via canon selects on setView's
    both-arms-assigned locals). (4) scalarization pushed unsafe-for-a
    statements RAW, skipping slot rewrites for OTHER arrays in them
    (`b[0] = a[i]` referenced dissolved `b` → compile error).
    2026-07-15 S2 COMPLETE — the for-body adoption + the REAL mechanism:
    the old kill+walk never killed STEP writes, so `for (; op+3 <= N;
    op += 3)` leaked iteration-1 flow state into proofs that were only
    runtime-safe because the cond bounds the index. The fixpoint now
    DERIVES that bound: widening join (escaping bound → ±IP_LIM),
    cond-∩ escape check (the back edge re-evaluates the condition),
    affine refine (`name ± c ⋚ K`, rhs = any access-free singleton incl
    `src.length|0`), strided transfer (`x += K`/`--` compute instead of
    null), canonical-for body-end exit gated on proven ≥1 trip. The
    strided-cursor invariant class (op ∈ [0, N−3]) erased whole checked
    families: sort 1941→1814 (0.96 WIN — ratcheted), wav 1721→1646,
    base64 1924→1847 (1-byte squeak → comfortable), hash 1164→1086,
    aos 1913→1894. medianUs insertion scan proven corpus-wide.
    2026-07-15 VM ARC CLOSED (watr 5.7.2, published): the reg[a] cluster
    class — jz's BRANCHLESS checked read is a BLOCK form ((block (result
    f64) (set $bi)(set $bn) (select cv(load(clamped)) UNDEF (get $bn))))
    that checkedRead/ring1 refused, so intguard rule 5 never saw the vm's
    register file; and unclamp ran AFTER intguard, whose if-form landed a
    round late into coalesced temps (the round-2-shapes trap, again). Fixes:
    checkedRead grows the block form + its post-unclamp if-tail twin (the
    set prefix rides {pre} ahead of the collapsed if), ring1 takes the
    block leaf, unclamp moves BEFORE intguard, and 5.7.1's unclamp accepts
    cv-wrapped loads + DEFINING-tee guards (the tee moves into the if
    condition; shared len tees keep defining for the arm's store guard).
    END STATE: runKernel ZERO selects / ZERO trunc_sat / one bounds branch
    + raw i32 load per register access — C's exact shape. vm −40% on M4
    (17.1→10.4ms), checksums exact. chainTable COUNTER-RESULT FLIPPED and
    the pass REJOINS the speed profile: 2.3%-slower was measured on FAT
    arms; with collapsed arms the table wins +6.3% (9.76 vs 10.37ms) —
    arm weight decides. CI RE-BASELINE LANDED (faab41b6 bench, Xeon):
    vm 71.9→21.5ms (−70% — the runner paid MORE for the f64 detour than
    M4's −49%): vs c-wasm 8.00→2.07×, v8 6.60→1.50×, as 3.80→1.34×,
    go-wasm 1.85→0.49× (jz now wins 2×), porffor beaten 5.7×. Residual
    2.07× owners: the one surviving cluster (JNZ's `reg[a] !== 0` — an
    f64.ne consumer, not ToInt32), code[o..o+2] fetch triple, dispatch
    structure vs C's direct-local br_table.
    RIVAL-WASM CAMPAIGN BASELINE (user directive; CI Xeon 6973P results
    f4053b6, honest WASM FIELD only — the `rust`/`go`/`zig` result columns
    are NATIVE binaries (target-cpu=native), not wasm; use *-wasm ids):
    vm 8.0× c-wasm / 6.6 v8 / 3.8 as (PRE-collapse numbers — re-baseline);
    immutable 3.9× c-wasm / 2.4 go-wasm / 2.0 v8 (fresh-record idiom —
    rust source gets value semantics free; jz must SCALARIZE the record
    replace across ps[i] (object-churn SRoA), currently loses to V8's
    escape analysis on CI); shapes 3.8× as / 3.7 c-wasm + wordcount 1.58
    c-wasm (hash-slot unit owns); lz 2.5× / qoi 1.75 / base64 1.7 c-wasm
    (codec family — dissect c-wasm loops); tail: noise 1.43 v8, sort 1.43
    as, mandelbrot 1.35 as, jessie 1.31 v8, crc32 1.23 v8, synth/wav ~1.1
    c-wasm. Campaign order: vm re-baseline (free) → hash-slot → immutable
    → codec family → tail.
    IMMUTABLE DESIGN (campaign case, next-session unit): the kernel is
    `const p = ps[i]; …; ps[i] = {x,y,vx,vy}` over a 4096-record array of
    ONE literal schema, int-certain fields, no surviving alias (the read
    projection dies per iteration; ps single-owner from initParticles).
    Engine transform: ARRAY-OF-RECORDS FLATTENING — when an array binding
    provably holds only one literal schema and is used solely via field
    projections + WHOLESALE literal replacement, lower to packed lanes
    (4×i32 here): `ps[i] = {…}` → 4 in-place stores, `p.x` → lane load,
    zero allocation, zero boxing. This is rust's value-semantics answer
    (3.9× c-wasm today; jz loses even to V8's escape analysis) and covers
    the reducer/state-machine fresh-record class generally. Builds on the
    existing schema/SRoA machinery; the new piece is the array-slot
    monomorphism proof + identity-unobservability gate (no alias escapes,
    no ===/Map-key use of the records).
    SELF-HOST BENCH CASE DNF ROOT-CAUSED (was failing on CI results
    f4053b6 too, masked in the loss table): MY S2-commit debug hooks in
    src/type.js used `globalThis.process?.env?.JZ_DBG_*` — a bare
    `globalThis` read compiles to an env.globalThis import in the
    self-host build → LinkError. House pattern is `typeof process !==
    'undefined' && process.env.…` (prep folds it dead) — fixed, case runs
    again (62.0ms M4, parity ok). watr 5.7.3 adds the missing
    constant-index br_table → br fold (branch) so chainTable'd dispatches
    keep folding post-inline like the if-chains they replace.
    HASH-SLOT PREMISE CORRECTED by the campaign method itself: wordcount.c
    wins 1.58× with a PLAIN FNV-1a + linear-probe + strcmp table — no
    SwissTable, no control bytes, same probing topology as jz. The c-wasm
    gap is per-probe INSTRUCTION COST (24-B seq+key+val entries vs C's
    lean slots; __ptr_type/offset unbox; cap-forward check; load-factor
    test placement), not probing strategy — and jz's SSO bit-equal compare
    is already cheaper than C's strcmp. SwissTable group probing stays
    relevant ONLY for the V8-row comparison (V8 x64 = SwissTable; 1.22×).
    Next concrete step: wasm2wat both upsert loops side by side, count the
    per-probe ops, cut the diff — then re-run wordcount/shapes/dict on M4
    + CI bench-probe.
    SORT WON + S2 NARROWING WAVE (2026-07-15, the post-sweep loss table's
    top row): the honest full-field M4 sweep after units 1-3 put the
    geomean at JZ 1.00× / C 1.85× / AS 1.99× / V8 2.14× with THREE
    losses (colorpq accuracy-hold, jessie IC-class, self-host row —
    see below); the stale-row re-verdict left sort (1.67× c-wasm) and
    vm (1.38×) as the real remaining M4 rows. Both closed:
    (1) S2 NARROWING PASSES (src/type.js loopFixpoint, ≤2 decreasing
    passes after the widen/verify): a name with no cond conjunct to
    re-clamp it sat at ±IP_LIM even when the loop's range is finite —
    heapsort's `i = child` copy chain. Each pass recomputes
    hull(entry, F(joined ∩ cond)) ∩ previous — sound (F monotone over a
    post-fixpoint) and strictly tightening. (2) SHORT-CIRCUIT
    REFINEMENT: `&&`'s rhs evaluates under the lhs verdict (the
    lookahead read `child+1 < n && a[child] < a[child+1]`), `||`'s rhs
    under ¬lhs; if-then applies refineAll (ALL conjuncts) not one.
    (3) RANGE-RHS refine: `child < end` with end a RANGE-valued name
    (the extract loop's downward iv) bounds by the op-side endpoint
    (hi for </<=, lo for >/>=). (4) typedLen ALIAS ARM
    (analyze.js makeTypedTracker): a bare-name alias (`let x = a` —
    the inliner's param-alias splice) carries the source's ctor AND
    static length (typed arrays never resize; views arrive via the
    subarray arm). heapsort sort: undefs 9→1, M4 5.5-5.7ms —
    jz BEATS c-wasm (1.04-1.05× behind us), AS 1.57× and V8 1.64×
    behind; -Os sort 1814→1647 B (the "sort = bounds-PROOF" owner
    closed at BOTH tiers). (5) watr 5.7.4 (repo committed, publish
    user-gated): f64.eq/ne of a checked-read IF-form vs a CONST
    distributes into the arms when both simplify (hit arm
    convert→raw i32 compare, NaN/const miss arm→const) — the vm JNZ
    cluster (`reg[a] !== 0`) drops its outer f64.ne + convert + NaN
    materialization: vm runKernel now 100% integer, −3.3% M4 (8.83→
    8.54ms); one-side-const ONLY (both-sides-checked f64.ne stays —
    undef!==undef=false vs f64.ne(NaN,NaN)=true, the recorded
    unsoundness). jz node_modules hand-synced (untracked — CI needs
    the npm publish before these rows move there).
    GROWING-BOUND UNSOUNDNESS KILLED (found by this wave's fail-closed
    pin, PRE-EXISTING — dist-reproduced on every canonical loop form):
    the canonical-iv seed `iv ∈ [entry, B−1]` is re-applied per pass as
    a body-independent theorem — FALSE when the body writes the bound
    (`while (i < n) { …; if (g) n = 12 }` read a[4..11] RAW → jz 36 vs
    JS NaN; for/</<= twins identical). Fix: boundInvariant — every name
    the bound reads must be unwritten AND undeclared in the body, gated
    at BOTH recognizers (canonical-for + while-iv). The residual
    undefined-vs-NaN flavor was the SENTINEL seam in compoundAssign:
    `s += a[i]` used bare asF64 (the '+' emitter's toNumF64
    checkedNumRead fold never ran) — the UNDEF payload rode f64 adds to
    the boundary; += now folds the miss arm like '+'. Pins:
    test/optimizer.js ×4 (heapsort both-loops proven + values;
    growing-bound fail-closed with NaN semantics; typedLen alias
    two-hop; += accumulator implied). Corpus checksums re-verified
    exact (20-case sweep incl. all 8 known references).
    STRUCTURAL-SLOTOF CORRUPTION KILLED (2026-07-15, the queued hunt —
    the "unique-prop read" diagnosis was one layer off): slotOf's
    STRUCTURAL arm (receiver proven OBJECT, sid unknown) checked slot
    consistency only among schemas CONTAINING the prop — an OBJECT of a
    schema LACKING it read the foreign slot (`p.x` on {z,w,q} → z) and
    the WRITE sibling CORRUPTED it in place (`p.x = 99` overwrote z —
    probe: 9901 vs JS 301 at O0; O2 correct by accident of facts). The
    "NaNInfin static-pool deref" manifestation was the PRE-fix
    composition with the call-position holes (unit 2 closed those).
    Fix at the root (module/schema.js, one condition): the structural
    bet is sound only under the FULL closed world — prop at the SAME
    slot in EVERY registered schema (bucket.length === list.length);
    unique-prop receivers keep guardedSlotOf's runtime-guarded devirt,
    everything else goes dynamic. Corpus census (JZ_DBG_SLOTOF sweep):
    the arm fired in exactly ONE bench (provenance memo.wre/wim,
    single-schema program — still fires ✓) — zero bench cost; shapes/
    jessie/wordcount ride the GUARDED path, parity re-verified. Pins:
    test/slot-hazards.js ×2 (cross-schema read+write JS-exact at both
    levels; shared-slot-everywhere keeps the fast path).
    FOLLOW-UP CLOSED AS STALE: "__dyn_get_t_h inline sidecar probe →
    lane" — the helper delegates to genLookupStrict(Prehashed)/
    __ihash_get_local, ALL lane-converted at the landing (scan proves
    no 24-B-stride probe loop remains anywhere in collection.js).
    wordcount's Xeon residual (~1.3× vs V8) therefore has NO cheap
    lever left — SwissTable-style v128 group probing stays the
    recorded V2-class idea. CODEC TAILS DISSECTED AND PARKED: qoi
    runKernel has ZERO undef sentinels / ZERO trunc_sat (54 lt_u =
    algorithm compares + store guards), base64 similar (9/2) — the
    checked-read class is fully burned; 1.16×/1.13× vs c-wasm are
    algorithmic/µarch territory, both beat V8.
    LZ WON — &&-COND WHILE VERSIONING (2026-07-15, the campaign's unit 3,
    the "symbolic-sum bounds" owner resolved WITHOUT a relational domain):
    the LZ match scan `while (len < maxLen && src[j+len] === src[ip+len])
    len++` needed j+len < srcLen from len < maxLen ≤ n−ip ∧ j < ip — but
    the EXISTING loop-versioning machinery (versionableTypedFor) already
    expresses it as affine extents (j + maxIv < srcLen, maxIv = maxLen−1);
    it just refused &&-conds and never scanned cond accesses. Extension
    (src/type.js): the countable bound must be the LEFTMOST conjunct —
    later conjuncts short-circuit AFTER it, so their accesses run only at
    iv < bound (EXACT pre-increment extents, forcePre) and a false
    conjunct only exits early (iv range never grows); rest conjuncts are
    scanned for candidates AFTER the body so a shared-key post-increment
    body access keeps its wider extent; the nest scan's sibling-decl
    entryHint sees through the && spine (condIvName). Bound-not-first
    shapes (`while (a[len] < 6 && len < n)`) reject outright — the access
    evaluates at iv == bound, fail-closed to fully-checked (pinned).
    M4 QUIET VERDICT (cs=2900100982 exact): lz 12.18 ms — LEADS c-wasm
    14.81 (1.22×) and V8 23.32 (1.92×); the pre-wave "1.71× behind" M4
    reading and the earlier 67 ms c-wasm number were suite-load-
    contended — quiet ratio moved ~2× on jz's side (the per-byte checked-
    read battery died: 2 lt_u+select+undef per compare → raw load8+eq).
    Family quiet table: qoi 10.68 vs c 9.22 (1.16×), base64 4.06 vs 3.59
    (1.13×) — tail-class, both beat V8. -Os rows byte-identical (speed-
    tier pass). Corpus sweep parity ok (conv2d/fft/blur/mandelbrot/vm/
    wav/crc32/sort/tokenizer/noise). Pins: test/optimizer.js ×2 (fast-arm
    raw byte compare + values at n=64/17; bound-not-first fail-closed).
    IMMUTABLE WON — ARRAY-OF-RECORDS FLATTENING LANDED (2026-07-15, the
    campaign's unit 2): the structInline carrier existed (Array<S> as K
    inline f64 cells) but REFUSED the immutable idiom at exactly one
    form — the wholesale replace `ps[i] = {S-literal}` (analyze.js
    poisoned every indexed store). Landed as two increments:
    (v1) analyzeStructInline accepts the replace store when the inplace
    sweep (scanInplaceStores, content-keyed — node identity dies in
    analyzeFuncForEmit's loop rewrites) proved alias-liveness AND
    target-binding reuse (same-index cursor precedes → separates the
    replace idiom from append-builders, which keep plain-layout JS
    extend); idx must be an int-certain name (fractional/negative = JS
    sidecar property, inexpressible inline). Emit arm
    (tryStructInlineReplaceStore, FIRST in emitElementAssign): spill
    box→idx→values (JS member-store order), ONE lt_u bounds check
    against physLen, K cell stores through the cursor-derived base
    (cursor − cellIdx·8, no __ptr_offset call); OOB writes DROP (the
    checked-typed-store contract; no grow call in the loop keeps base
    hoists sound). (v2) PACKED i32 CELLS (ctx.schema.inlineCellI32):
    all-slots-strict-int32 (slotI32Certain, hazard-belted) + K ≥ 2 +
    no bracket-keyed cursor reads → K raw i32 fields in ⌈K/2⌉ cells —
    C's exact record layout (immutable: stride 16, 4× i32.load /
    i32.store, ZERO trunc_sat/convert). The packed decision rides
    CURSOR NODES (inlineCellCursors → readVar's .cellI32 tag), never
    the bare sid — a standalone {S} object of the same sid keeps f64
    slots. New packedI32 carrier in src/abi/object.js (the seam's
    promised "packed" sibling); structInline(K, packed) grows cpe;
    push/length/slot-read/dot-write/replace-store all branch on it.
    M4 FIELD VERDICT (quiet, cs=1726748178 exact everywhere): jz
    0.24 ms LEADS ALL — c-wasm 0.42 (1.79×), go-wasm 0.46 (1.94×),
    rust-wasm 0.55 (2.32×), V8 0.63 (2.64×), AS 0.99 (4.18×) — from
    3.9× BEHIND c-wasm; jz binary 1.8 kB vs C 925 kB. The C residual
    explained honestly: same 4-load/4-store loop but LLVM lowered the
    rare bounce conditionals to flat selects (dependency chains every
    iteration); jz's branches predict not-taken ≈ free. -Os rows
    byte-stable (aos 1894 / sort 1814 / hash 1086 — aos is floats, no
    packing). THREE PRE-EXISTING HOLES FOUND + CLOSED en route (all
    dist-reproduced, pinned in test/struct-inline.js):
    (1) tryInplaceReplaceStore spilled VALUES before the INDEX —
    `a[i++] = {x: i}` computed x from pre-increment i at every
    optimize level (fix: box→idx→values order, + box spilled once).
    (2) Call-expr compositions were invisible to the eligibility walk:
    frames with no tracked arrays were SKIPPED (`!reps` + arrName-empty
    early-outs) so `use(mk())` in a helper-free main never checked
    param agreement, and `mk().length` (an un-sanctioned call position)
    read the PHYSICAL cell count — dist returns 2 for a 1-element
    K=3 array TODAY. Fix: every frame walks; verifyCall does the
    arg-agreement (name AND call-expr args); safeArrSource requires
    exact return-fact match; un-sanctioned Array<S>-returning call
    positions poison (expression-body return sanctioned on agreement).
    (3) OPEN, minimal repro saved (probe-min2.mjs): missing-prop reads
    on an unresolved receiver resolve UNGUARDED when the prop names a
    field on exactly one schema — `use(ps){ const p = ps[0]; p.x }`
    with callers passing Array<{x,y}> AND Array<{z,w,q}> emits a RAW
    slot-0 load (no schema guard, no dyn fallback, both opt levels):
    the {z,w,q} leg returns z's value (3) instead of undefined. The
    bare-getter-hijack sibling for USER props. PRE-FIX this composed
    into static-pool derefs (f64 bits 0x6e69666e494e614e = ASCII
    "NaNInfin" — the formatter literals read as numbers); this unit's
    call-composition fixes already removed that manifestation — the
    residual is the wrong-slot VALUE, not memory garbage. NEXT
    correctness hunt: the unresolved-receiver unique-prop read must
    guard (emitSchemaSlotGuarded) or fall to dyn.
    Pins: test/struct-inline.js (11 tests: packed engagement wat +
    values, f64-cells leg, odd-K pad, cursor write, alias-after-store
    JS identity, value-position store, element escape, call-expr
    .length agreement, push logical length, OOB-drop contract, idx
    eval order); slot-hazards + inference wat asserts re-pinned to the
    packed shape. FOLLOW-UPS: shapes/wordcount re-check on CI probe;
    SoA (per-field lanes) only if a vectorizable consumer shows up —
    AoS is C's layout and won the row.
    HASH LANE LANDED (the SoA increment, variant C — minimal blast
    radius): every Set/Map/HASH table carries an i32 hash lane (cap×4 B,
    zero-filled, AFTER the entries) — the only thing probes walk (one
    4-byte load/step, 16 hash checks per cache line vs 2-3 at 24-B
    stride; miss chains touch an 8 kB lane instead of sweeping 48 kB
    through L1). Entries keep [hash|seq][key][val] — iteration, heal,
    durable logs, delete-shift, coll_order UNTOUCHED; unconverted
    readers (e.g. __dyn_get_t_h's inline sidecar probe — the jessie
    path, named follow-up) degrade to the entry walk, never corrupt.
    Writers all maintain the lane: 8 templates, grow-rehash,
    backward-shift delete (parallel lane cursors), .clear, __map_from
    (the lane-less alloc that let inserts write PAST the table —
    caught by the bool-identity gate, pinned via the data.js lane-churn
    differential), obj_clone byte-copy (28-stride), interop mem.Hash.
    Zombies keep their stale lane hash (noticed on hash-hit; cap-tries
    fallback rescans via shared cold $__zomb_scan). VERDICTS — M4:
    wordcount +7.2% cs exact, dict neutral, immutable/shapes −3..−11%
    PROVEN layout-class (hot fn byte-identical modulo call indices);
    CI bench-probe (Xeon, 5 rounds, jz/v8 ratio-normalized across two
    machine instances): wordcount 1.37→1.25 (+9%), dict 0.73→0.445
    (+64% — jz 2.1× faster absolute), immutable 2.06→1.20 (+72% — the
    M4 loss FLIPS on the runner the losses were reported from),
    shapes 1.27→1.44 (−13%, uncertain: different runner instances,
    v8 base differed 25%; M4 says ~−3%; shapes' hot loop touches NO
    tables — cold dyn-miss arms shifted). Dyn-object golden
    re-baselined 12285→13009 (documented in-chain). FOLLOW-UPS:
    convert __dyn_get_t_h's inline probe to the lane (jessie),
    re-baseline shapes on one runner instance, consider outlining the
    guarded-slot dyn-miss arms (cold-code layout sensitivity).
    UPSERT DISSECTION DONE (zig cc -O3 wordcount.c → wat, probe loop at
    FNV sites): C's probe = shl 2 + load keys[h] + CALL strcmp (LLVM does
    NOT inline it) + (h+1)&2047 reload; hash = byte-at-a-time FNV per
    call (~5 ops × len). jz's per-probe INSTRUCTIONS are already cheaper
    (SSO arithmetic hash ~8 ops flat beats FNV on ≤8-char words; i64
    bit-compare beats a strcmp call). THE GAP IS PROBE FOOTPRINT: C
    probes a 4-byte-stride key-pointer array (2048×4 = 8 kB, L1-resident;
    counts touched only on hit) while jz probes 24-byte entries
    ([seq][key][val], 2048×24 = 48 kB, stride-24 with the key at +8) —
    6× the probe bytes, L1-evicting. OWNER: SoA dict layout — contiguous
    i64 KEY LANE (16 kB at cap 2048) probed alone; seq+val in a parallel
    region indexed by slot; growth/iteration/durable logs re-based on the
    two-lane layout. Fresh-session unit (touches every gen* fn); verdict
    loop = wordcount/shapes/dict M4 interleaved + CI bench-probe.
    chainTable COUNTER-RESULT (watr 5.7.0, published): dense
    same-scrutinee if/else-if chain → br_table (C's switch lowering,
    result-typed chains br the arm value out) — correct on the vm
    dispatch (checksums exact, ladder fully gone) but 2.3% SLOWER
    interleaved on M4: the vm's op stream is PATTERNED (2,3,4,5 loop),
    the chain predicts nearly free, the indirect jump pays its own
    prediction. Shipped as an opt-in pass, NOT in the speed profile
    (seltree's caveat, mirrored). EPYC verdict pending (needs a
    bench-probe leg that opts the pass in). vm's REAL remaining owner
    (both machines): the reg[a] checked-read select clusters that
    intguard rule-5 refuses — the len temp (`$o`) tees inside one
    cluster and is REUSED by the arm's store guard, failing the
    self-contained gate; the extension is a hoisted shared-bounds form
    (one `lt_u a len` tee feeding both the read collapse and the store
    guard).
    PULL-CHAIN AUDIT ANSWERED (color-space __to_str): kernel fns'
    untyped-param arithmetic → toNumF64 t==t + __to_num cold call →
    __to_num's spec fallback (module/number.js: non-string pointers go
    ToString per ToNumber(ToPrimitive)) statically deps __to_str → its
    number arm IS the Ryū printer (~28 kB riding a cold diagnostic arm).
    Levers, unimplemented: (a) boundary-owns-coercion — the JS export
    wrapper ToNumbers f64-lane args host-side (exact, zero wasm bytes),
    in-module params become provably numeric, chain severed; (b) split
    __to_num's non-string-pointer arm into __to_num_obj included only
    when object/array values can reach a ToNumber site. Also latent,
    recorded: scalarized f64 compound `slot += "3"` string-RHS edge;
    zero-trip body-end exit predates S2 for non-canonical loops (now
    GATED on proven trip ≥ 1 — strictly sounder than shipped).
  * [x] 10 more bench cases - each area covered
  * STATE 2026-07-09 (JSC leg measured): quiet-machine full table, 49 cases ran.
    GEOMEAN: jz beats every engine — V8 1.89x, deno 1.83x, JSC 1.50x, bun 1.52x
    slower than jz. Headline-corpus violations (engine beats jz): dispatch 0.29
    (JSC only — its call-IC crushes our call_indirect fan-out; V8 1.07 beaten),
    immutable 0.51 (V8/bun; JSC 1.08 ok), wordcount 0.63 (all), strbuild 0.74
    (all), crc32/dict/colorconv 0.76 (JSC-only; V8 beaten), shapes 0.89
    (V8-only; JSC 2.6x beaten), json 0.96 (JSC, borderline). Lab probes (out of
    geomean): jessie 0.42-0.60 standing worst (residual: .loc sidecar churn,
    closure8 descriptor walk); colorpq 0.84 vs V8. jz self-host lab case was
    DNF (env.globalThis import — dead-guard-arm reads; fixed via prep dead-arm
    fold + watr cntOracle guard) — now RUNS and BEATS every engine ~2x on the
    full-pipeline compile workload (jz.wasm 21.98ms vs jsc 39.9 / bun 44.0 /
    v8 46.7). Fastest-wasm race (tokenizer/qoi/crc32 vs c/as, CI-jitter band)
    + Sierpinski floatbeat unchanged. Evidence: /tmp/bench-table.txt.
  * dispatch lever 1 (2026-07-09): devirt arms now INLINE tiny pure bodies
    (inlinePureCallExpr grew callee-local renaming — a caller/callee name
    collision self-assigned tees, pinned in test/closures.js) + static const
    arrays fold base/len to literals under new never-resized/never-aliased
    program facts (arrResized/nameEscapes; base derives from global.get — the
    static-prefix-strip rebases AFTER the fold, a baked offset trapped OOB,
    pinned in minimal-output + closures). Interleaved A/B: +4.5% only —
    residual is the br_table mispredict + the f64↔i32 serial chain through
    loop-carried x (arms are int-pure; guards+converts survive because closure
    ABI args are untyped). Next levers, in order: (a) peepholes
    `trunc_sat(convert_i32(X))→extend(X)` and `f64.ne(convert_i32(X), NaN/inf
    -const)→1` — kills the k-arm chain outright; (b) loop-carried f64→i32
    local narrowing when all defs are convert(i32) and all uses trunc — kills
    the x-arm chain; (c) branchless select-tree lowering when ALL arms inline
    int-pure and tiny — what JSC does (2.29ms ≈ beats native C's fn-ptr
    dispatch 4.94; jz 7.91, V8 8.54 — we beat V8, JSC needs (a)+(b)+(c)).
  * dispatch lever 2 (2026-07-09): (a) LANDED as watr identities (28942bd):
    trunc∘convert exact round-trips + f64 eq/ne of convert_i32 vs impossible
    const; jz devirt spills i32 args as i32 and re-materializes the convert at
    each use (syntactic → identities fire); inliner false-positive leak fixed
    (caller arg named like a callee local — injected-identity set). Interleaved
    A/B +12.8% over levers-off. TRIED-AND-REVERTED: dispatch-site arg lattice
    merged into element bodies' paramTypes/minArgc (kills their guards) — prep
    pre-evals `ops[1]` to the closure ref before program facts see the read, so
    no AST gate proves the tagged sites are the only callers; the trusted body
    truncated raw box bits on a string through the alias. Any revival needs a
    PREP-time escape record at the fold site, not AST counters. Discovered
    pre-existing gap (control-verified): string arg through an element-value
    alias skips ToNumber (pick("3",1) → 1 not 2) — untyped generic-call
    coercion family, noted in test/closures.js. Remaining (b) loop-carried
    f64→i32 local narrowing (watr-side generic: all defs convert(i32) → retype,
    wrap stray gets; would let x's ToInt32 guard + trunc die) and (c) branchless
    select-tree — both still needed for JSC's 2.29ms.
  * dispatch lever 3 (2026-07-09): (b) LANDED — dispatch arms are now RAW INT
    OPS (`get x; get k; i32.xor; br`), the entire ToInt32 guard/convert layer
    dead. Chain: watr `narrowLocals` (f64 local written only by exact converts
    retypes i32; PROFIT-GATED — unconditional narrowing tripped the buf/nest
    op-count ratchets +24/+11, reads now classify by consumer with tees value-
    transparent) + watr `intguard` (counted ToInt32-guard-select collapse) +
    watr identity block-hoist (trailing convert out of LABEL-LESS blocks — emit
    wrapper blocks hid convert defs from narrow) + jz devirt i32 BLOCK-NARROW
    (facts-gated static table + every candidate body convert-topped → arms br
    raw i32, call arms trunc_sat-wrapped, one convert re-boxes; x's def then
    syntactic-convert). PASS ORDER LOAD-BEARING: narrow after identity, before
    intguard/merge — merge unifies identical-valued guard temps in-round, then
    the one-reader gate never passes (watr PASSES comment). A/B vs levers-off:
    1.12x — UNCHANGED from guards-alive: the br_table MISPREDICT shadows all
    arm micro-ops on unpredictable streams. ⇒ (c) branchless select-tree is
    THE remaining dispatch lever: all arms now tiny+pure+int (the exact
    precondition), compute all 8 + 3-level select tree ≈ 9-12 cycles vs
    mispredict ~15-20; needs trap-free arm gate + in-range fast path; closure0
    (impure `+` body) must inline for 8/8 — its str-concat guard survives
    foldStrDispatchF64, investigate there first.
  * dispatch lever 4 (2026-07-09): (c) BUILT AND LANDED, verdict humbling.
    watr `seltree` (dense 4-8-arm br_table ladder of speculable arms → select
    tree behind ONE in-range branch; arm gates: pure never-trapping whitelist,
    arm-local tee/set writes only, ≤96 tokens; the index keeps its exact
    unconditional evaluation). Enablers: devirt inlines from the UNFILTERED
    candidate map (arm position preserves execution conditions — closure0's
    impure `+` body inlines; ONE fn-wide inline-temp counter — a per-site
    counter minted duplicate locals when a const-folded receiver spilled
    nothing, pinned in closures); guardRefine `foldStrProbes` folds the whole
    `if (is_str(a)||is_str(b)) concat else add` dispatch to the numeric arm
    under provably-int args (matched whole-if PRE-order — per-probe folding
    leaves or/if shapes nothing const-folds through; operand tees kept as
    drops). PASS ORDER extended: narrow → guardRefine → intguard so the
    dispatch resolves fully in ROUND 1 (coalesce at round end shares temp
    slots across arms; counted locality gates die on round-2 shapes).
    RESULT: br_table fully eliminated on dispatch, checksum exact, all suites
    green — but interleaved A/B = 0.993 (NEUTRAL): the fixed 16K-entry stream
    repeats, and the CPU's indirect-branch predictor LEARNS it — the
    mispredict the tree buys back wasn't being paid. seltree ships DEFAULT-OFF
    (a predictable stream makes br_table ~free while the tree pays every arm),
    speed-profile opt-in; QUIET-MACHINE verdict + a genuinely-unpredictable
    stream variant still owed before declaring it dead or alive. JSC's 2.29ms
    edge therefore is NOT (only) branchlessness — next probe: total op-count
    per iteration + JSC's actual codegen. watr commits pending publish:
    59b0ef5, 28942bd, cbf2d72, cc22b89, ea09930.
  * provenance leg 1 (2026-07-09): the NEW audio cases (fftplan 10.9x behind
    JSC / 6.8x V8 — worst in corpus; provenance 8.9x) name the structural gap:
    typed-array KIND LOSS through non-local provenance (inference was
    RHS-syntactic only). LANDED (test/provenance-inference.js, 8 pins): (1)
    ctx.schema.slotTypedCtors — the elem-ctor sibling of slotTypes, censused in
    observeProgramSlots; (2) slotTypedCtorAt/BySid readers, gated on the prop
    NEVER being written program-wide (writtenProps, fail-closed); (3) field
    evidence in the module-let ctor fixpoint + a LATE re-run (after
    narrowSignatures — return sids + censuses only exist then) + body-cache
    invalidation; (4) refineFieldProvenance binds module-const sids from
    ABI-backed return schemas; (5) narrow's typedCtor arg lattice gets
    per-caller sid maps (module-const seeds, locals shadow, assignments
    poison) so `sum(P.wre, n)` types the callee param. Edges now TYPED:
    ret, field (bound + inline), paramViaField. TRIED-AND-REVERTED: value-
    level "kind or nullish" return facts (fnReturnTypedElem/Sid) + @map:
    Map-value nodes + {}-literal sid evidence — an unguarded typed unbox on a
    nullish/dyn-undefined value reads GARBAGE MEMORY (composite-route OOB at
    O0, control returns undefined; regression in degree). Revival needs a
    GUARDED unbox (tag-checked pointer materialization, hoistable out of hot
    loops) or non-null flow proofs — THE design item for memo/map edges and
    the fftplan composite (its plan flows through memo global + Map cache +
    a local closure param — closure-param kind flow is the other missing
    link). fftplan/provenance rows unchanged until those land; machine was
    load-13 all leg, quiet-machine numbers owed.
  * provenance leg 2 (2026-07-09, b788388): the guarded design LANDED as
    speculative typed-param specialization — the engines' own move (guard
    tags at the call, specialize the callee) rather than per-read unbox.
    speculateTypedParams (narrow) + emitSpeculativeCall (emit) +
    slotTypedCtorByProp (schema census, guardedSlotOf contract). Weak
    recursive evidence lattice: proven | field census | single-binding init
    | enclosing-arrow param met over the arrow's own call sites | return
    census with nullish SKIPPED (Map/memo getters census through — the
    guard eats the nulls at runtime). Evidence-less sites NEUTRAL;
    conflicts kill; cycle guard path-local (backtracks — inlined-duplicate
    sites re-resolve). RESULT: fftplan 28.2→2.44ms LEADS JSC 2.72/V8 3.97;
    provenance 19.5→2.00ms LEADS JSC 2.13/V8 3.20; checksums exact; suite
    2730/2730, selfhost 20/20+5/5 fresh kernel. BONUS root fix: nullish
    module-let decl init now records nullable on the global rep — the memo
    idiom (`let last = null; if (last === null) last = make()`) was folding
    its guard to a constant at EVERY optimize level and silently never
    memoizing (strictSentinel non-nullable fold). TRIED-AND-REVERTED: jz-IR
    read-only loop unswitch (doubled every unknown-source ctor-copy loop,
    +92B golden, no bench win). Numbers still load-13-machine; quiet owed.
  * violations leg (2026-07-09, a87baee): re-measured queue — immutable
    1.85x v8 (worst), wordcount 1.43x v8, shapes 1.24x v8, json 1.24x jsc,
    strbuild 1.17x jsc. immutable profiled to three costs: (1) second dyn
    element read at the in-place store — FIXED (sweep records the tracked
    alias; ptr-narrowed alias discharges the guard statically: store = bare
    slot overwrites, -0.5kB); (2) ToInt32-NaN-guards per field read — the
    slot-int census self-poisons on the rebuild-from-own-read idiom; made
    it a greatest fixpoint (optimistic slot reads, flip→re-derive) but the
    kernel's `p = ps[i]` receiver is unresolvable at census time (elem-sid
    knowledge is narrow/emit-late) so immutable itself didn't move —
    NEXT INCREMENT: late census re-run with body-local elem-sid resolution
    (facts.arrElemSchemas + paramReps route, as inplace-sweep's elemInfo),
    needs a FRESH rebuild (not monotone re-run) after narrowSignatures;
    (3) STRUCTURAL residual: fields stored as f64 boxes vs V8's SMIs — the
    named lever is i32 SLOT STORAGE for intCertain slots (schema-slot
    representation change, the big one); plus per-iteration __ptr_offset
    call LICM once stores can't relocate (raw in-place store enables it —
    hoistInvariantPtrOffset doesn't recognize it yet), plus watr
    foldImmutableGlobals (immutable const global.get → const inline).
  * wordcount profiled (1.43x v8): per-token path is __is_str_key +
    __str_hash (hcache HITS — the lazy hash cell works) + __hash_get_local
    + __dyn_get_expr + __hash_set_local + TWO __durable_slot_log barriers.
    Get and set are SEPARATE probes: tryHashRmwFusion never fires because
    `const counts = {}` registers an (empty) schema → valTypeOf = OBJECT,
    and the gate wants HASH/unknown; the object then does keyed access via
    its dyn-prop SIDECAR hash anyway — worst of both. LEVERS (next leg):
    (a) dyn-keyed-only empty-literal objects (dynKeyVars census exists)
    should LOWER TO HASH outright — dictionary-mode objects, the engines'
    own move; then RMW fusion fires and halves the probes; (b) audit the
    per-store __durable_*_log write barriers (two per token); (c) dedupe
    the doubled __is_str_key per access. strbuild/shapes/json unprofiled.
  * violations leg 2 (2026-07-09, 158abe7/4a77ad2/de52447): three cases
    flipped or moved, all engine-level levers:
    - strbuild 2.29→1.18ms LEADS JSC 1.39 + V8 1.82: (1) string concat-
      CHAIN fusion (emit '+') — a ≥3-leaf chain lowers to ONE measure→
      alloc→copy pass instead of per-+ pairwise (triangular prefix
      re-copy gone); node joins the chain only when a side is statically
      STRING (BOOL/OBJECT as node-qualifiers broke bool addition — caught
      by destruct pins); self-accum head stays pairwise (bump-extend
      lives); result MUST route __sso_norm — a ≤6-char heap result breaks
      the SSO-canonicality invariant and representation-keyed lookups
      MISS (caught by watr-metacircular type-dedup pins). (2)
      $__str_byteLen added to PURE_CALL_I32 (strings immutable; the
      bump-extend mutator only fires on provably-dead old values) —
      `j < line.length` hoists out of char loops.
    - shapes 3.65→2.59ms LEADS V8 3.21: emitSchemaSlotGuarded stamps
      guardedNumSlot when its ONE schema censuses the slot NUMBER +
      writtenProps-clean; toNumF64 SINKS the coercion into the arms
      (guard-hit raw load passes bare, only the dyn-miss arm pays
      __to_num). The 8-schema measure(o) dispatch drops a __to_num call
      per field per record. REMAINING shapes levers (profiled, valuable):
      dead zero-init stores per record (~24/record — WATR-side DSE: kill
      local.set x (const 0) when set-before-read on all paths; watr repo
      work), .prop CSE within one expression (o.r read twice).
    - wordcount RMW fusion FIXED (never fired): dictionary-mode {} reps
      VAL.HASH but the decl-site flow overlay stamps the literal's OBJECT
      kind — the receiver gate now honors the rep; single probe per token
      (5.51→4.04ms absolute; ratio ~1.45x vs faster-idle V8). REMAINING:
      per-token __durable_*_log barrier audit; the fused path had ZERO
      test coverage — value pins added (test/objects.js).
    - json PROFILED (agents, full diagnosis in workflow journal): levers =
      SWAR wide-word key compares in the schema-directed inline parser
      (module/json.js), parser cursor state (__jppos/__jpstr/__jplen)
      globals→locals/params, __jp_num inlining into the specialized path,
      whitespace-skip fusion, per-iteration arena scoping. UNIMPLEMENTED.
  * SELF-HOST RECOVERY (2026-07-09, e621c53): kernel-target suite was
    silently broken 172 fails since 1f36c9d (nanPrefixMaskHex) — the
    kernel could not compile Map/Set/static-object programs AT ALL.
    Roots: (1) i64Hex routed through BigInt toString(16); under self-host
    BigInts are raw SIGNED i64 bits, so the first bit-63-set caller
    rendered "-8000…" and the kernel emitted unparseable i64 consts
    (surfaced as "Bad int"/"Error: 0"/compile-OOB). Now formatted via
    logical-shifted 32-bit halves; host-byte-identical (pinned in
    invariants). (2) __set_add embedded durableEntryLogIR's
    $__durable_slot_log call with NO explicit deps edge (hasVal=false
    skips slotLogDeps) — the kernel's auto-dep scan silently yields
    nothing (the documented selfhost-includes class) so every
    `new Set(...)` died. test/selfhost-includes.js tightened from
    union-reachability to PER-TEMPLATE transitive closure — immediately
    surfaced + fixed 4 more latent holes (__static_str→__mkstr,
    __map_new→__alloc_hdr_n, __jput_str→__jput, __jput_num→__jput_str).
    Kernel leg now 2422/2446 (18 fails). RESIDUE (open, repro'd):
    - alternating-round durable-heal OOB: compiling
      `const g = m.get('a'); g.mut` poisons the NEXT kernel round
      (rounds 1,3 fail / 0,2 pass — scratchpad/kern-seq.mjs); trap in a
      (i64)→i32 helper hashing a dangling key — the zombie/heal machinery.
    - byte-parity DIFF (loop/closure/data probes): kernel's resolveIncludes
      autoDepsOf realize/scan yields nothing for __alloc's template →
      __memgrow reaches includes late → the global-snapshot sweep misses
      __heap_end → watr inline drift (+bytes, behavior EQUAL). All sweep
      CONSTRUCTS probe equal now (scratchpad/sweep-probe.mjs) — remaining
      root is WHY autoDepsOf's realize/matchAll diverges in-kernel.
    - 18 kernel-leg fails: multi-module 'Unknown module' shapes (arguably
      mis-classified for the kernel leg — it has no module resolver by
      construction), destructure-assignment `({a,b} = obj)` internal.
  * violations leg 3 (2026-07-09, 5807563/3073247 + watr 7ad05df):
    - immutable 1.06→0.73ms (−31%): analyzeSchemaSlotIntCertain gains a
      LATE mode (plan's post-narrowing block) — FRESH census rebuild with
      per-body element-alias sids (`const p = ps[i]` through the param's
      arrayElemSchema / local arrElemSchemas facts, knowledge that exists
      only after narrowSignatures). Sound to rebuild (not just widen):
      every consumer reads at emit. Residual vs V8 0.42 (1.7x): f64-boxed
      slots vs SMIs — i32 SLOT STORAGE stays the named big lever.
    - json 0.23→0.13ms LEADS JSC 0.15 (1.11x) + V8 0.26 (1.92x): SWAR key
      matching in the shaped parser — expectText compares 8/4/2/1-byte
      chunks against packed LE constants (one load+compare+branch per
      CHUNK, one pos advance); in-bounds by the existing len+8 alloc with
      8-byte 0xFF sentinel (sentinel-overlap fails into generic reparse ✓
      bit-exact). Remaining json levers recorded (cursor globals→locals,
      __jp_num inline, ws-skip fusion) — now BELOW the lead, optional.
    - watr `deadset` (7ad05df, PENDING PUBLISH): drop const local.set
      overwritten on every path before any read — the inliner zero-init
      shape (shapes' ~24/record). First-x-op scan, ITERATIVE (the CPS
      draft + the naive continuation unwinding each blew the stack on
      kernel-size functions — three rewrites: fork-only recursion,
      depth-cap 512, in-loop continuation unwinding); runs ONCE
      pre-rounds (post-coalesce slot sharing aliases per-name liveness —
      a real "x"+1→"x0" miscompile caught during development by jz's
      preeval pins). watr suites 256+590 green; jz suite/selfhost green
      against the local copy; shapes number ~neutral on V8 (its regalloc
      absorbs dead stores) — ships as codegen-quality/size.
    - foldImmutableGlobals CROSSED OFF: V8 constant-folds immutable
      global.get at wasm-compile time; watr's `globals` pass is size-
      gated by design. Non-lever.
    - wordcount RE-VERIFIED fused pre-watr (hash_slot+slot_write; the
      census noise earlier was stdlib text). 3.89ms vs V8 2.63 (1.5x) —
      residual is probe-structural (str_hash+bucket+str_eq per token vs
      dictionary ICs); next named lever: key-pointer interning for the
      probe loop + the durable-barrier audit.
    QUEUE STATE after leg 3: fftplan/provenance/fft/strbuild/shapes/json
    LEAD both engines; sort/mat4/raytrace/hashjoin lead; wordcount 1.5x,
    immutable 1.7x behind V8 (both with named structural levers);
    dispatch 1.07x-beaten V8 / JSC-only gap stands (predictor-bound).
  * violations leg 4 (2026-07-10, aa77000/9adc984/ca6986a/a343424 on
    published watr 5.3.6): IMMUTABLE FLIPPED + a census soundness audit.
    - $__mkptr → NON_MUTATING_CALLS (one line, aa77000): the in-place
      store's re-boxed result was the ONE call pinning hoistInvariantLoop's
      purity gate — the immutable/wordcount loops re-ran the full
      __ptr_offset forwarding+bounds dance per iteration. Hoist now fires
      (pinned: inner loop has zero ptr_offset calls).
    - SLOT-CENSUS SOUNDNESS AUDIT (9adc984): probing the extern-write
      question (JSON parsers writing into censused sids) surfaced FIVE
      probed-live miscompile families — dyn keyed writes vs floor-elision
      AND vs slotVT NUMBER (raw arithmetic on a string box → NaN), `.prop=`
      through unresolvable receivers, compound assigns (`o.x += 0.5` never
      censused), plain writes (slotTypes observed ONLY literals — `o.x =
      'oops'; o.x + 1` skipped concat dispatch), const-JSON floats into
      literal-shared sids. Repair: collectSlotWriteHazards — one
      program-wide write-family scan (keyed/delete/destructure/spread/
      assign/JSON shapes) applied at every census (re)build + gated in
      every reader (schema.js belts, kind.js shapeOf-arm census deferral);
      hazards RECOMPUTE post-narrowing (paramReps type receivers — early
      pass had poisoned the world off fftplan's `re[j]=tr` on a
      then-unnarrowed param) and slotTypes gained the late fresh rebuild
      the int census already had. JSON shaped/const sids are KIND-SAFE
      (any shape divergence falls back to the generic parser, whose sids
      are DISJOINT by construction — __schema_next seeds past the
      compile-time table): slotTypes observes sample kinds, json keeps its
      shaped fast path; value-facts (intCertain/ctors) fail closed.
      Compound writes now OBSERVE their effective value (`o.n++` → `o.n+1`
      through the optimistic fixpoint — int compound counters keep
      certainty). 7 regression pins (test/slot-hazards.js).
    - STRICT-I32 SLOT LATTICE (ca6986a) — the "i32 slot storage" lever
      landed WITHOUT a layout change: the int census graduated to 3 levels
      (0 / 1 integral / 2 strict-int32: bitwise minus `>>>`, in-range
      literals, bools, comparisons, imul/clz32 — never -0, trunc-exact),
      one monotone-down fixpoint (type.js intLevelMap) with boolean
      projections for all existing callers. Strict slots load as
      `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` directly in i32 (guard-free), exprType types
      their ternary locals i32, and emit re-derives the locals slice after
      inferLocals binds elem-alias sids (the analyzeBody-before-
      analyzeValTypes ordering hole). immutable 0.75→0.31ms: LEADS V8
      (0.44, 1.4x) and JSC (0.73, 2.3x) — was 1.74x BEHIND. Range-edge
      pins: 3e9 / >>>0 / % / u- slots stay level 1.
    - wordcount discharges (a343424): fused-RMW statically-numeric result
      → bare i64.store (durable barrier provably dead, __is_eph_bits call
      dies); generic __to_num sites test f64.eq(v,v) inline (non-NaN IS
      its ToNumber; optimize-gated); fusion's unknown-key arm inlines the
      6-op NaN+tag test. 1.49x → ~1.3x behind V8. REMAINING (named): the
      per-token __ptr_offset(words) — needs cross-function neverGrown for
      PARAMS. NOT body-local-only: callee-reachable aliases can grow the
      array mid-call, and arrResized/nameEscapes are NAME-keyed (the
      builder's `words.push` collides with the kernel's read-only param of
      the same name) — needs an escape-aware caller fixpoint feeding the
      existing localReps.neverGrown consumer at array.js:831; then
      __str_hash SSO-arm inline.
  * violations leg 5 (2026-07-10, e36668c/394ab5b): wordcount to V8 PARITY.
    - cross-function neverGrown for array PARAMS (e36668c): the
      activation-scoped proof — during any call of f the param's array can
      only relocate if code RUNNING WITHIN the activation grows an array it
      can reach. neverGrown iff safeReads(body, p) + f and every transitive
      callee ARRAY-GROWTH-FREE (no resize/.length=/non-literal-key indexed
      write on a possibly-ARRAY receiver; OBJECT/HASH/TYPED receivers exempt
      — keyed writes there land in slots/dict tables, arena-bump never moves
      arrays; unknown callees / computed calls / writtenProps-shadowable
      methods / bare func-ref args poison). Poison fixpoint over the direct
      call graph; receiver kinds via body valTypes overlay + paramReps (the
      dictionary `{}` decl and TYPED params resolve) — name-keyed
      arrResized/nameEscapes could NOT express this (builder's `words.push`
      collides with the kernel's same-named read-only param). Consumer:
      module/array.js raw-base read (skips __ptr_offset per element). Pins:
      test/never-grown.js incl. all three fail-closed directions.
    - tiered $__str_hash in genSlotUpsert (394ab5b): SSO mix + hcache-cell
      load inline at the fused probe; cold shapes call the helper. FOUND
      DURING: $__str_hash's final clamp is i32.le_s — it shifts every
      NEGATIVE hash by 2, not just the 0/1 empty/tombstone guards (and pre-
      clamp -2/-1 → 0/1 COLLIDE with empty/tombstone, a 1-in-2G pre-existing
      quirk, noted); the untailed transcription re-inserted every
      negative-hash key — caught by dictionary RMW value pins + a
      divergence trap.
    - wordcount: 1.36x → 1.10x (neverGrown) → 1.04x (tiered hash) vs V8;
      JSC beaten. Remaining ~4%: probe-loop micro-structure — V8-parity
      band, machine-noise dominated.
    - jessie DIAGNOSED (agent, quantified per-parse helper counts): NOT two
      residuals but three — parse$space char-scan __ptr_offset 27% of
      helper traffic (module-global receiver blocks hoisting; strings are
      stable pointees — a per-loop base hoist tolerant of global rewrites
      is the lever), closure8 call_indirect volume 11.3% (lever: same-BODY
      indirect devirt — prove every table value shares one closure.make
      body → direct call with env arg; existing devirtConstFnArrayCalls
      requires capture-free const literals, subscript's table is neither),
      .loc dyn-set 2.6% (lever: array-expando header slot — the array
      analogue of static-object schema tier 2). Dyn-prop READ chain already
      collapsed 46% → 8.4% by prior legs. Agent's 'jessie crashes under
      default memory' claim NOT reproduced through the real bench harness
      (6/6 clean) — likely its raw-instantiate harness artifact; watch.
    - jessie levers GROUND OUT (2026-07-10, two worktree agents, both
      verdicts humbling and precise):
      * 27% base-hoist lever: COMPLETE as a two-pass chain (both halves
        landed). Half 1: hoistLoopGlobalPtrOffset (e3c6d38) — per-loop
        stable-pointee global base hoist, callee cleanliness via the
        existing collectReachableGlobalWrites fixpoint, fail-closed on
        call_indirect/call_ref; ablation + fail-closed pins
        (test/hoist-loop-global.js, wat-invariants). Alone it was jessie
        byte-identical: `cur` (assigned only inside parse()'s body) never
        proved STRING under depth-0-only recordGlobalRep, so the
        durable-receiver override probe's own call_indirect stayed in
        every scan loop. Half 2 (agent, merged 6e06538):
        inferModuleGlobalValTypes — whole-program shadow-aware all-writers
        scan in plan/scope.js, run twice (pass 1 pre-narrow on
        literal/alias evidence; pass 2 post-narrowSignatures with
        paramReps so `cur = s` bare-param aliases resolve); fail-closed on
        kind conflicts, same-name local shadowing, host-writable exported
        mutable globals; six pins in test/inference.js incl. all three
        fail-closed directions. `cur` proves STRING → probe leaves the
        loops → the hoist fires. MEASURED on merged main (load-8 machine):
        jessie 2286→2111µs (-7.7%, 1.54x→1.46x behind V8, checksum
        exact); statics: call_indirect 81→29, __dyn_get_expr 67→13,
        __ptr_offset sites 135→113 (the hoist's increment over the
        agent-standalone 140→135), wasm -10%. Next named jessie residual
        (agent's profiling): closure dispatch convention ~25%.
      * 11.3% same-body devirt lever: REFUTED BY PROOF — the agent built the
        full write-family scan (dyn closure tables → constFnArrays reuse) and
        it correctly refuses subscript's table: ≥8 distinct closure bodies
        write into it (string/module/number/template.js each register their
        own), genuinely polymorphic, NOT the same-body shape the profiling
        assumed. Machinery left on branch worktree-agent-aca96e30f3fea719d
        (byte-identical on jessie = zero present value; take it if a
        monomorphic dyn table ever shows up in a bench).
  * pow leg (2026-07-10, 07f6346, agent-ported in a worktree + merged):
    $math.pow's non-integer tail (single-precision exp(y·log x), relative
    error ~|y·ln x| ulps) replaced with the fdlibm e_pow core (FreeBSD msun
    + musl scalbn, cited — the same algorithm V8 ports). Special cases +
    integer binary-exponentiation fast path bit-unchanged. Differential vs
    host Math.pow: 651/672 grid bit-exact + 21 at 1 ulp, 64/64 random ≤1
    ulp, 42k-case sweep zero >1 ulp (test/pow-ulp.js). test/math.js's
    constant-exponent fold pin relaxed to tolerance (that fold is a
    separate deliberately-cheap path, no longer bit-identical to the
    now-correct pow).
    colorpq UNMOVED by design finding: its exponents are compile-time
    CONSTANTS routed through the scalar const-exponent exp∘log fold
    (module/math.js ~396) + its vectorized twin (vectorize.js:3180) —
    $math.pow is never called. colorlch (fifthroot algebraic path) and
    colorlog (exp2) likewise carry pre-existing engine-checksum DIFFs from
    the same FAST-TRANSCENDENTAL-FOLD ACCURACY family. Named residual: a
    compensated (double-double log) const-exponent fold — scalar AND
    vectorized — would close the parity family; a naive de-vectorization
    would close parity but lose the SIMD lead (colorlch leads V8 1.5x,
    colorlog 1.8x today). Also noted pre-existing: integer fast path
    overflows to 0 for pow(huge, -3) (squaring hits Inf before the
    reciprocal); kernel-leg 5 worktree failures were worktree artifacts.
    COMPENSATED-FOLD VERDICT (2026-07-10, worktree agent, NOT merged):
    the double-double const-exponent fold was built ($math.pow_fold +
    SIMD repack twin) and CLOSED THE ULP GAP (≤1 ulp on colorpq's actual
    exponents) but full checksum parity is UNREACHABLE — fdlibm is
    "nearly rounded", not correctly-rounded (even $math.pow_core is
    651/672 bit-exact vs host), and the strided-hash checksums need
    bit-exactness at every sample. Speed: the correct algorithm costs
    ~4x a scalar V8 Math.pow call → colorpq 3.76x SLOWER (vs 1.20x
    today) — accuracy at that price loses the V1 bench mandate; branch
    worktree-agent-a645ccd97ec575d12 holds it (incl. two latent fixes to
    take with any revival: PPC_CALL2 call-lift hardcodes unary/binary
    arity, LATE_VEC_HELPERS allowlist misses new SIMD helper names).
    CHERRY-PICKED from it: fifthroot fold pow(-Inf, k/5) → +Infinity
    (was NaN; f800b0c). colorpq/colorlch/colorlog parity stays a
    recorded ULP-family DIFF — closing it needs a CORRECTLY-ROUNDED pow
    (e.g. CORE-MATH's two-phase scheme), a different, larger project.
    STATE 2026-07-10 (full 52-case table, jz/v8/jsc): svg geomean —
    V8 2.09x slower than jz (was 1.89x at leg 3). 43/52 cases jz LEADS
    BOTH engines outright. V8 beats jz on only THREE: wordcount 1.36x
    (named lever above), colorpq 1.20x (lab; jz checksum ULP-differs from
    both engines — jz's Math.pow, pre-existing float note), jessie 1.51x
    (standing worst lab case — .loc sidecar churn, closure8 descriptor
    walk). JSC-only-beaten six (V8 beaten in all): dispatch 3.8x (call-IC,
    predictor-bound — recorded), crc32/dict/colorconv (recorded JSC-only
    class), synth 1.11x, json 1.14x (CI-jitter band — LED JSC 0.13 vs
    0.15 in this session's quiet runs). Self-host row: jz.wasm 24.2ms
    BEATS V8 40.0 (1.66x) and JSC 35.0 (1.45x) full-pipeline; parity
    column still DIFF (the recorded autoDepsOf byte-parity OPEN item).
    All 66 examples compile clean. Gates at close: suite 2742/2748,
    ratchet 6/6, selfhost 20/20+5/5, size geomean vs binaryen 0.964.
    bench-compile.mjs NOTE: its jessie lab case fails on subscript
    node_modules path resolution (bench-harness module resolution, the
    known 'Unknown module' class — NOT a compile regression; the main
    bench table's jessie compiles and runs).
* [x] compiler architecture closure — finite V1 gate (not “perfection”)
  * Closure means every box below is executable evidence; it does not mean no
    future optimization is possible. Benchmark leadership remains the separate
    gate above.
  * [x] Optimized semantics: checked-by-default typed OOB behavior plus focused
    fail-closed regressions for aliases, mutation, postfix indexes, codec cursor
    budgets, eager booleans, hash capacity, and mutable globals.
  * [x] Differential proof: `npm run test:fuzz` — 5,000 generated programs ×
    opt {0,1,2,3} × 20 inputs, 76,204 compared, zero divergences (2026-07-15).
  * [x] Compiler-state isolation: full opt0/opt2/opt3/WASI matrix passes; warm
    and fresh self-host modes are separately exercised.
  * [x] Optimizer ownership: watr is the only post-IR optimizer; no binaryen
    runtime dependency. Required inline/reset and self-host fixes are published
    as watr 5.7.7, not local patches.
  * [x] Self-bootstrap: real programs round-trip through rebuilt `dist/jz.wasm`;
    warm self-host compilation has a strict `<0.99× V8` geomean gate.
  * [x] Final closure battery on the 2026-07-15 worktree: matrix 3,005 pass /
    17,318 assertions at the core opt2 leg (full matrix 3,005 pass, 6 skip);
    test262 language 2,978 pass + 2,156 expected negative rejects, 0 fail;
    built-ins 984 pass, 0 fail; self-host 21/21 plus 5 perf pins; fuzz 5,000
    programs / 76,204 compared inputs / 0 divergences. Re-run on the release
    commit if this worktree changes.
  * [ ] How to reduce the size of jz.js (eg. twice)? Is there any structures that can be folded or which don't add any value?
    * [x] dead-pass ablation sweep (2026-07-09): specializePtrBase,
      sortStrPoolByFreq, deadStoreElim, csePureExprLoop + the vestigial 'post'
      phase DELETED — byte-identical outputs proven across 50 benches + 66
      examples + the self-host kernel at all watr tiers (~900 lines, dist/jz.js
      -9.5KB, dist/jz.wasm -370KB). Kept-with-evidence: cseScalarLoad (aos 25%),
      hoistInvariantPtrOffset (shapes).
    * next: value-unknown group needs corpus bench-timing (hoistAddrBase -2KB
      when off!, hoistInvariantLoop vs watrLicm double-LICM, promoteGlobals,
      internStrings, propagateSingleUse — disabling it is smaller AND faster to
      compile). THE fold that halves jz.js: migrate src/optimize (vectorize.js
      369KB + index.js 229KB) INTO watr — one optimizer, one walker infra.
  * [ ] How to increase the compilation speed of jz.js? Is there pipeline optimizations, streamlining or better abs3traction altogether to make compilation speed multiple times faster? Some folding or waste cutout possible - what can be killed of merged without effect?
    * measured: watr's generic walkers = ~30% of compile (walk 679ms/profile);
      tallyLocals specialized upstream (watr e83c858); dead-pass deletions bought
      ~5-8%/corpus. Next: specialize writesOf/cseFactsOf/hashFunc callbacks or
      arrays-only walker variants (half of nodes are leaves).
  * [x] How to shave off the size of produced wasms? Attain level better than wasm-opt for produced wasms? We have three options - own post-watr wat optimize pass, watr/optimize or wasm-opt, but ideally we'd internalize the optimizer so that's more efficient than wasm-opt, as well as fast.
    * DONE 2026-07-09: watr-as-optimizer vs binaryen-as-optimizer on IDENTICAL
      pre-opt input = 0.998 geomean (8 cases; beats on crc32/json/dict/
      tokenizer/mandelbrot, json 0.991). Landed: watr `ifset` (one-armed
      if→select, speed profile + jz size tier; nqueens -6% as a speed bonus)
      and watr `zeroinit` (drop set-of-spec-zero; float -0 excluded — a real
      sign-flip bug caught by the sort pin during development). The optimizer
      is fully internal (no wasm-opt anywhere in the pipeline). Remaining
      binaryen edge if we ever want more margin: ~40 extra tiny-helper inlines
      + br/br_if forms (recorded, optional).
* [x] jz.wasm beats V8 — strict executable gate
  * CURRENT 2026-07-15: `test/selfhost-perf.js` uses 20 tier-up warmups and
    20 paired samples with alternating JS/WASM order (rather than unrelated
    independent minima). Both warm and fresh-instance compile geomeans must be
    `<0.99×` the same compiler on V8. Repeated paired measurements: warm
    ~0.94–0.98×, fresh ~0.71–0.76×; latest full `test:self` passed 21/21
    bootstrap tests plus all five perf pins.
  * I need your expertize to make jz.wasm faster than v8. I suspect there's too many string ops, or strings are too complex and could be done simpler OR not versatile enough, or there's some internal structure missing or redundant, or some internal optimizations possible, to reach the level of jz.wasm performing faster than jz.js. Now it's seemingly slower and we need to beat V8 and JSC. The point is not optimizing the source, but making current structures more efficient, so that generally any compiled WASM is faster than V8.
  * SELF-HOST-ROW "REGRESSION" INVESTIGATED + DISPROVEN AS A REGRESSION
    (2026-07-15): the sweep put the jz self-host row at 74.7ms vs V8 33.5
    (2.23×), read as a regression from the ledger's "41.75 DEAD EVEN"
    (2026-07-12). GROUND-TRUTH A/B (worktree at 54877403 = the SESSION-START
    commit, before ALL 5 of today's commits, vs HEAD, same quiet machine):
    baseline jz.wasm 74.0 / 66.2ms (1.97× / 2.02×) — IDENTICAL to HEAD
    (60-74ms, 1.73-2.15×). So today's work (packed arrays, &&-versioning,
    slotOf, S2 wave) did NOT regress the row; the "41.75 dead-even" was a
    quiet-machine reading on a different day. THE ROW GAP IS METHODOLOGY,
    definitively: the fresh-instance perf-ratchet (test:self, 22 programs,
    jz.wasm vs jz.js-on-V8) shows jz.wasm 0.968× — jz.wasm BEATS V8. The ONLY
    difference from the row is that the row reuses ONE no-GC wasm instance for
    45 compiles (~0.5GB arena watermark, ~11MB gross bump-alloc/compile of a
    10-line program, never freed) while the ratchet uses a FRESH instance per
    program. jz.js GCs the transient churn (heap Δ only 644KB net/compile);
    the wasm arena keeps ALL of it. Heap-alloc profile: the compiler's own
    per-compile allocation is DIFFUSE (walkN 0.54MB, scan 0.53, emitElementAssign
    0.52, scalarize 0.52 — no single dominant jz allocator; the 9.8MB `decode`
    top-line is node-internal TextDecoder, not the wasm arena). So there is NO
    single lever — beating V8 on the accumulating row is the broad gross-
    allocation-reduction campaign this item names (or the known-open warm-
    instance _clear-reuse soundness fix — the ratchet documents it traps on a
    trivial WAT compiled twice in one instance, "root cause not yet found").
    A V2-scale structural effort, NOT a today-regression. LANDED alongside:
    two proven-safe (byte-identical -Os output across all 8 size cases)
    compile-time reductions to TODAY's features — narrowing runs its ≤2 extra
    interval-walk passes only when a name widened to ±IP_LIM (the widening join
    sets any escaping endpoint to the sentinel, so IP_LIM-presence is exactly
    the narrowing precondition — non-escaped names sit at their exact one-step
    hull and cannot narrow); structInline's per-frame call-composition walk
    skips array-free frames when no function returns Array<S> (a provable
    no-op). Neither moves the row (its 3 test programs trigger neither) but
    both trim the S2/packed-array analyzer cost on loop-heavy + large inputs.
  * STATE 2026-07-09: warm self-host compile = 1.004x jz.js GEOMEAN (sort 0.97,
    mandelbrot 0.98, crc32 1.00 BEAT it; mat4 1.06 lags), fresh-instance 1.097x.
    The item reduces to: mat4-shape warm gap + fresh-instance init cost. Not a
    strings problem — the string-ops suspicion was refuted by the parity data.
  * BENCH EVIDENCE (JSC leg): the bench jz lab case (full pipeline, process-per
    -run = cold-start methodology) has jz.wasm at 23.1ms vs jz.js on jsc 32.5 /
    bun 35.1 / node 39.2 / deno 43.4 — jz.wasm beats V8 AND JSC 1.4-1.9x cold,
    at warm parity (1.004x). Coherent: wasm needs no JIT warmup; engines pay
    parse+tier-up of 2.4MB compiler JS every fresh process.
  * OPEN (fidelity, not correctness): kernel output is behavior-equal but NOT
    byte-equal to host output (bench jz row parity column shows DIFF; kernel cs
    4208029189 vs engines 2693214886, each side internally deterministic).
    Narrowed 2026-07-09: divergence is PRE-watr, in assemble.js's global-
    snapshot sweep — host emits `(global.set $__heap_end (i32.const 0))` in
    __clear, kernel omits it (then watr inline decisions drift downstream:
    host inlines __memgrow, kernel keeps it → +1 type, ±bytes). Harmless:
    stale __heap_end is a monotonic memory-size cache, still valid after
    _clear. NOT a regex bug (matchAll char-class probe equal host/kernel).
    Suspect: kernel-side behavior of the sweep's Set-iteration + dynamic
    stdlib[name] bracket reads + globals.get(...).mut chain. Repro:
    scratchpad/self-parity.mjs (3 probes: bytes DIFF, behavior EQUAL).
    Goal when picked up: byte-exact self-host → bench parity column 'ok'.
    Narrowed further 2026-07-10: __alloc's manual deps edge __memgrow
    EXISTS (module/core.js:40) so the fixpoint edge isn't the miss; jz-
    compiled probes of BOTH scan constructs — matchAll group extraction
    (m[1]) and the sweep's `\\(global\\.set \\$([A-Za-z0-9_.$]+)` with $
    and . inside the char class — are EQUAL host/kernel at O0+O2. The
    divergence is therefore kernel-EXECUTION state, most likely a thunked
    template's expansion-time ctx reads differing in-kernel (the sweep
    memoizes `stdlib[name] = src()` at line ~739 — heapResetWat()-style
    ctx.scope.globals reads at that moment) or a bracket-read timing
    difference. NEXT: instrumented dist (resolveIncludes/sweep records a
    diagnostic readable through the kernel boundary — e.g. a '2diag'
    optimize-flag path returning the diagnostic string instead of wasm),
    run self-parity.mjs against it, compare the three record sets.
  * INSTRUMENTED-KERNEL SESSION (2026-07-10, 9888cbd/281afc5): the channel
    (scripts/self.js compileDiag — diagSink snapshots in resolveIncludes +
    the assemble sweep, JSON through the kernel boundary, diffed
    host-vs-kernel) landed and IMMEDIATELY paid: TWO real host-side
    miscompile roots found and fixed, both suite-green with pins.
    - ROOT 1 (9888cbd): the kernel's own `autoCache.get(name) !==
      undefined` compiled to an UNCONDITIONAL return — mayBeNullish only
      flagged nullish literals/ternaries, sound while opaque sources had
      no value kind; the Map/element value-kind inference broke that and
      emit's strictSentinel fold erased the miss guard AT EVERY LEVEL
      (dist builds at optimize:false). Fix: fail-closed mayBeNullish
      (anything not structurally non-nullish is nullable — the flag only
      suppresses sentinel folds + capture propagation). Pinned via the
      dedupe-cache memo idiom (hit-count, both levels).
    - ROOT 2 (281afc5): the sweep's `src.matchAll(...)` on the typeof-
      continue-narrowed receiver silently scanned NOTHING — matchAll had
      only a `.string:` emitter, so the runtime string-fork (needs BOTH
      keys) never armed; untyped receivers fell to the dyn-prop probe →
      undefined → for-of swallowed it. Fix: generic `.matchAll` twin
      (ES ToString-coerces the receiver) → the same anchored scan.
      Host-level repro of the exact sweep shape pinned at both levels.
    - RESOLVED (2026-07-10, dbd3293/367b151): the "per-export clone" suspicion
      was WRONG — the mother bug was BOOLEAN IDENTITY LOSS. Chain: kernel's
      resolveOptimize gets JSON.parse('1') = NUMBER 1; jz lowered `opt === true`
      on an unknown operand to NUMERIC equality → 1 === true → TRUE → level-2
      branch; there `{...LEVEL_PRESETS[2]}` read UNDEFINED (Object.freeze
      wrapper blinded the literal's schema → untyped element dispatch, no
      OBJECT arm) → spread {} → empty cfg → every `cfg.pass !== false` gate ran
      + watr off → level-'1' kernel output drifted (csePureExpr/foldSetToTee
      fired). Also: fromEntries preset values stored as raw 0/1 (`false` read
      back as number 0 — `0 !== false` true). Fixes, all landed with pins
      (test/bool-identity.js, 6 tests):
      * carrierF64 ingress — bools cross EVERY untyped carrier as TRUE/FALSE
        atoms: array literal elems + push/fill/unshift, Map/Set keys+values
        (bridge 'I' casts + .set/.get), dyn-keyed writes, closure + direct call
        args (narrow stamps settled p.val; val-known params keep raw 0/1 ABI).
      * emitStrictEq: unknown-vs-bool-literal compares ATOM BITS (1===true
        false); both-BOOL compares truth values (carriers vary by source).
      * Mixed ?:/&&/||/?? merges box the BOOL arm (watr's `i ? true : [from,
        len]` rec marker — metacircular type-dedup pin); VT['?:'] carries only
        BOOL∪NUMBER (both-arms-are-the-value ⇒ a carried pointer-kind claim let
        strict-eq const-fold wrongly); &&/|| keep the full guard-idiom carry.
      * '+' string-dispatch numeric arm: inline atom ladder coerces NaN-boxed
        operands (true+1=2, null+1=1) — no __to_num (formatter tree stays out
        of the dyn-object golden); isNumArm/typed-load valKind evidence skips
        guards in numeric kernels; foldStrDispatchF64 unwraps the guard so
        plasma still folds+vectorizes. nest ratchet re-baselined 8559→8834
        (guards on '+' over unknown-param array elems are load-bearing).
      * Object.freeze folds to its operand in prepare (jz never modeled
        frozenness; the wrapper only blinded schema dispatch). __typed_set_idx
        ToNumbers NaN-boxes (spec). JSON.parse const-bool claims BOOL. Export
        wrappers extract the result bit via __is_truthy (bare f64.ne(v,0) read
        FALSE_NAN as truthy — JSON.parse("false") exported true).
      RESULT: kernel-vs-host parity levels 0 AND 1 byte-IDENTICAL; dist
      kernel -163 kB (freeze-fold made jz's own preset tables static);
      benches re-verified no-regression (wordcount 1.008x parity, immutable/
      json/dict/shapes/fftplan/strbuild/mandelbrot all still lead, checksums
      exact). REMAINING level-2 residual, sharply narrowed: watr-IN-KERNEL
      makes a different `inlineOnce` decision (__memgrow spliced by host, kept
      by kernel; ±bytes, behavior EQUAL) — jz-side emission parity-proven by
      the L0/L1 identity, so the divergence is inside watr's optimizer running
      under the kernel; watr's own source carries a prior self-host workaround
      note in exactly that region (optimize.js ~4442 "KEEP THIS EXTRACTED").
      INSTRUMENTED (same session, patches reverted — recipe: temporary
      `export const _jzInlDiag = []` + pushes in node_modules/watr/src/
      optimize.js at inlineOnce's candidate loop / mayInline gate /
      normalize's fill loop; scripts/self.js compileDiag imports it from
      'watr/optimize', runs optimizeTail, and stuffs `diag.inl`; rebuild
      dist, run compileDiag host+kernel, diff). FINDINGS, razor-sharp:
      (1) pre-watr L2 text is byte-IDENTICAL ({level:2,watr:false}) — the
      divergence is 100% inside watr-in-kernel; (2) kernel NEVER CALLS
      inlineOnce — the `(opts.inlineOnce || opts.inline) && mayInline(ast)`
      gate fails with opts.inlineOnce = UNDEFINED (host: true); mayInline
      itself agrees host/kernel; (3) inside normalize() the fill-write
      `m[p[0]] = p[2]` LANDS (typeof m.inlineOnce === 'boolean' right
      after the loop, fill counts identical 43/35) but the SAME object
      read after `return m` has inlineOnce UNDEFINED, and Object.keys
      counts 51 in-kernel vs 45 host — SIX DUPLICATE KEYS: insert-time vs
      probe-time hash/probe divergence in the dyn-prop sidecar (dup
      entries; different probes hit different copies). (4) a host-side
      REPLICA of the exact normalize shape (45-key spread-built dict, 35
      static-table fill-writes, named reads before/after return) compiles
      CORRECT at both levels — the miscompile needs the REAL module
      context; prime remaining suspect: the real PASSES table's elements
      are [string, FUNCTION-REF, bool, string] tuples (closure boxes in a
      const array — the constFnArrays/fnElements machinery may retag or
      relocate the table) and/or the tiered $__str_hash hcache-cell fast
      path (394ab5b) computing a different hash for the interned pass-name
      strings at re-probe time than genSlotUpsert stored at insert.
      Function-refs-in-table replica ALSO clean host-side — the miscompile
      needs the full 100-module bundle context (the narrow/spec layout-
      sensitive class). Tiered-$__str_hash bisect NEGATIVE: kernel built
      with the genSlotUpsert inline forced off still DIFFs at L2 (L0/L1
      stay identical) — the insert/probe divergence is NOT the tiered fast
      path. Remaining suspects: the spread-copy path building `m` (dict
      spread enumerates+rewrites entries — a miscompiled iterator could
      duplicate), Object.keys enumeration double-counting, or a narrow/
      spec clone of one of the dict helpers only reachable in the bundle.
      SHARPENED (same session, continued): the "6 duplicate keys" were
      actually SIX PHANTOM KEYS — `op l p map word kw` (parser-state
      names!) enumerated by watr's `opts` object in-kernel, an object
      jz's own optimizeTail builds fresh as `{loopify:false}` + named
      writes. A freshly built object's dyn-prop SIDECAR aliased a dead
      dict from an earlier pipeline phase ⇒ pointer-keyed sidecar
      resolution (global __dyn_props registry / header props field) +
      arena address reuse hands a new object a dead object's sidecar.
      Same layer as kern-seq's durable-heal OOB — evidence handed to the
      heal agent (registry-purge invariant + mid-compile rewind checks).
      ALSO FIXED en route, host-level (83106cb): resolveSchema of a
      spread-bearing literal filtered to ':'-entries while
      emitObjectSpread built the full merged slot layout — Object.keys/
      values/entries/for-in/JSON.stringify of `{ ...S, z }` silently
      dropped every spread-copied key (values stayed readable). Now both
      phases share spreadLiteralSchema (null on unknown source → HASH →
      runtime enumeration); comma-grouped literal children unwrapped;
      pinned across all five enumeration surfaces (test/objects.js).
      This was HOW normalize's cfg lost its pass defaults; the phantom
      sidecar aliasing is WHY opts carries foreign keys — L2 parity stays
      blocked on the latter (heal agent's lane).
      kern-seq OOB, heal-agent verdict (honest no-kill, decisive
      narrowing): the "durable-heal" framing was WRONG — `_clear()` NEVER
      RUNS in the repro (exported __heap grows monotonically ~19MB/round
      across all 8 rounds), so NO rewind/reuse is involved; the phantom
      keys were likewise observed rewind-free ⇒ the corruption is a WILD
      pointer/write during KERNEL-EXECUTED EMIT, not stale-after-rewind.
      Exact trigger shape: `const g = m.get('a')` → bindAssignSchema
      POISONS g (non-literal RHS) → `g.mut` hits emitPropAccess's
      vt==null branch → ctx.schema.guardedSlotOf(prop) (unique-schema
      guard) → emitSchemaSlotGuarded — explains all three probe
      variants. Trap chain: __len ← withRefinements (flow-types) ← emit
      dispatch closures. optimize:0 always safe; ANY single trivial pass
      (treeshake alone, sortLocalsByUse alone, fusedRewrite alone)
      reproduces ⇒ passes are layout perturbers only, corruption
      precedes them. Two real IR-aliasing convention violations found
      (emitTypeTag embeds its receiver node twice; emitSchemaSlotGuarded
      shares va between fast arm and slow()) — fixed as hypotheses, did
      NOT clear the repro, reverted honestly (real hygiene items, not
      the root). Agent worktree also re-fixed two pre-existing base bugs
      main already has (i64Hex halves, Array.isArray-as-value) — not
      merged. Repro/bisect tooling preserved in the session scratchpad
      (bisect-passes.mjs, repro-diag.mjs, build-named-kernel.mjs).
      KILLED (2026-07-10, hunt agent, merged ad45071/90056b4): the wild
      write was a REBOXED OBJECT POINTER SILENTLY CARRYING SCHEMA 0 —
      three coupled defects in the pointer-ABI narrowing:
      (1) applyPointerParamAbi's OBJECT arm set p.ptrKind but never
      p.ptrAux, and boxPtrIR/asF64 default a missing aux to 0 on re-box —
      a narrowed-then-reboxed OBJECT param carried whatever schema
      registered FIRST program-wide instead of its own (the foreign-
      sidecar phantom keys = another object's schema/props read through
      the wrong sid; needs the full bundle because the colliding schema-0
      owner only exists there); (2) passthroughPtrParam recognized only
      a direct `return param`, not same-function recursive delegation
      (`return f(param, …)` — watr's recursive helpers), so eligible
      functions never proved pointer-ABI and mixed narrowed/boxed chains;
      (3) emitSchemaSlotGuarded/emitTypeTag shared one IR node across two
      tree positions (cloneIR now exported from src/ir.js and applied) —
      single-visit passes could free a local behind the second occurrence.
      Differentially verified (pre-fix narrow.js/ir.js/core.js reads a
      NEIGHBORING schema's slot: 222-or-undefined instead of 111) +
      pinned: test/objects.js host pin, test/selfhost.js warm-kernel
      no-_clear stress (Map.get → unknown-schema prop access, 2 field
      variants × 30 rounds). MAIN re-verified post-merge: kern-seq 10/10
      clean, suite 2787/2793 + ratchet 6/6 + selfhost 5/5, dist rebuilt,
      wordcount LEADS with exact checksum, jessie exact checksum.
      L2 RESIDUAL (manifestation 3) — DIAGNOSED, fix withheld honestly:
      watr's `opts = normalize(opts)` reassigns a param whose call-sites
      all prove VAL.OBJECT while normalize actually returns a HASH; the
      per-body tracker has no param decl node to re-seed from and can't
      resolve the call RHS, so the stale OBJECT fact rides into
      emitPropAccess → OBJECT off-16 propsPtr layout read on a HASH — a
      genuine layout type-confusion (this is why opts.inlineOnce reads
      undefined at the gate → inlineOnce never runs in-kernel → the
      __memgrow inline byte-drift). EVERY fix variant (entry-kind guard
      at analyzeFuncForEmit, D-step re-seed deletion, consumer-side
      emitPropAccess gates broad and narrow) fixes L2 parity but exposes
      a FOURTH pre-existing bug: __alloc_hdr_n OOB after ~22-28 warm
      compiles with NO _clear — allocation-pressure-sensitive, different
      call paths per fix variant (dyn_set/parseIf, map_set/optimize
      closure), control code-reorder stays clean ⇒ routing MORE dispatch
      through the guardedSlotOf/dyn-props path retriggers it. NEXT named
      hunt: root-cause __alloc_hdr_n OOB under sustained dyn-props
      allocation pressure (no rewind involved) — THEN re-apply the
      manifestation-3 fix (the reverted variant is in the hunt branch:
      6cfc4b2 on hunt-kernel-corruption, revert rationale in e229248).
    - for-of over nullish: DECIDED + LANDED (8f7b380) — throws per ES
      (catchable $__jz_err), guard only in __iter_arr's unknown-receiver arm
      (typed receivers pay nothing). Pinned in test/iteration.js.
    - BYTE-PARITY COMPLETE (2026-07-11, 2b482a2 + 77331c4): all three
      self-parity probes byte-IDENTICAL at ALL levels (9/9), and the full
      bench lab input compiles kernel==host byte-exact (in-process L2 and
      the -Os build both cs=3935718203 == engines' reference). Two final
      roots, both ordinary jz miscompiles the kernel tripped on:
      * unshift SPREAD ordering (2b482a2): prepends compose right-to-left,
        so `a.unshift(1, ...ys)` must run the spread loop (end→start)
        BEFORE the normal args — emitSingleSpreadMethodCall did the
        opposite ([...ys, 1, …]) and emitMultiSpreadMethodCall walked
        segments forward. Fixed with evaluation order preserved (normals
        spill to temps L→R, operations run R→L). This was assemble.js's
        own `inject.unshift(setBase, ...snapSlots)` — the __gsnap_base
        stmt reorder seen in every closure/data diff. Pinned
        (test/spread.js; multi-arg emitter landed earlier at 5ea4d15).
      * `.size`/`.length` DOT-NAME HIJACK (77331c4): the bare '.size'
        getter read __len of ANY unproven receiver — `{size: 4}` → 0 —
        so the kernel's stripStaticDataPrefix read
        `ctx.runtime.internTable.size` as 0 and never shifted the intern
        slot: THE final L2 data byte (kern 68 = pre-strip, host 11).
        Fixed at the right altitude: `.size` = typed SET/MAP getters +
        runtime dispatch (SET|MAP → __len, else __dyn_get_expr_t_h);
        __length gets a gated dyn-prop fallback arm (only when a schema
        or hash machinery exists AND collection.js is registered);
        proven-OBJECT/HASH receivers skip ALL bare getters (own props
        win, static slot); Set/Map `.length` → undefined per ES (the
        shared-layout __len shortcut lied). Diagnosed via compileDiag
        intern records (host {size:4, shifted:[[1,132,68,11]]} vs kernel
        {size:0, shifted:[]}). Pinned test/objects.js, 4 surfaces.
      NARROWED, recorded: '.byteLength'/'.buffer'/'.byteOffset' bare getters still
      hijack UNKNOWN receivers carrying same-named own props (proven
      OBJECT/HASH now safe); notString OBJECT receivers still route
      .length → __len. Same fix shape when picked up.
      REMAINING — speed-tier lab-row throw, ROOT-CAUSED (2026-07-11),
      fix designed but deliberately not landed tired (see hazards):
      * Bisect chain, every step verified: L3 preset ablation → ONLY
        `inlineFns:false` heals (OK + cs=ref) → sub-ablation → ONLY the
        hoistNestedCalls leg → per-callee skip over the 16 hoistable
        leaves → ONLY `_i64Hex16` (watr optimize.js) → per-caller skip:
        skipping EITHER _i64Canon (3 splices) or strengthNode (1) heals;
        control skips (dollar ×6, getOrAllocLanedLocal ×3) still throw ⇒
        semantic, not layout.
      * Mechanism: inlining _i64Hex16 splices `v.toString(16)` into
        callers where v binds a BIGINT∪NULL expression (`cb ?
        BigInt(cb.value) : null`, `neg ? -BigInt(mag) : BigInt(mag)`),
        AND removes the fresh-BigInt call sites that used to type the
        remaining real function's param. VT['?:'] deliberately returns
        null for mixed arms (strict-eq fold honesty) ⇒ receiver vt null
        ⇒ tryRuntimeStringFork's non-NaN arm claims it as NUMBER —
        `.number:toString(16)` formats raw i64 bits as a denormal
        ("0.000…0"), poisoning watr's const-canon strings → downstream
        throw. 3-line repro, wrong at EVERY level (not speed-specific;
        speed only EXPOSES it via inlining):
        `const r = a > 0 ? BigInt(a) : null; r == null ? 'null' :
        r.toString(16)` → "0.0000…" instead of "ff". Also wrong via
        `if`-guard and `!=` forms — no nullish refinement strips the
        union anywhere.
      * WHY static-only: a raw-i64 BIGINT carrier is UNTAGGABLE at
        runtime (non-NaN f64 bits ≡ number bits) — no runtime fork can
        ever rescue it; the static kind is the only truth. Tagged kinds
        (string/array/…) are fine in the fork — the hole is exactly
        BIGINT.
      * Fix design (canonical, NOT landed): BIGINT union-grade carry —
        (1) VT['?:']/'??' return VAL.BIGINT when one arm is BIGINT and
        the other a nullish LITERAL (mayBeNullish at the decl already
        sets rep.nullable — analyze.js:919 — and nullableOperand
        (emit.js:1739) already keeps `x == null` folds honest for
        kind+nullable reps, so the local story is complete); (2) the
        narrow.js param val-lattice must OR-propagate nullability from
        call-site args into paramReps/sig (TODAY it stamps bare
        `p.val` — narrow.js:1218-1226 — so a BIGINT-nullable arg would
        claim val=BIGINT on the param WITHOUT nullable and
        strictSentinel would FOLD the callee's `r == null` guard —
        _i64Arith's guard is live (folders pass real nulls), i.e. the
        naive VT-only fix trades a wrong string for a broken guard —
        THE hazard that stopped the tired landing); (3) re-gate: full
        suite + bench spot-checks + the lab row at speed.
      * Lab assets (scratchpad, fix2-wt worktree at 77331c4):
        ablate.mjs (compileJzAt-mirror + cfg-keyed gates ablNotrans/
        ablNohoist/ablSkipHoist/ablSkipCaller/ablList in fix2-wt's
        plan/inline.js — LAB ONLY, never commit), hoist log shows 13
        splices at speed; decode-exc.mjs; intern-diag.mjs (compileDiag
        intern records).
      SESSION 2026-07-12 — VT carry LANDED (ce80bbe: VT['?:'] BIGINT/
      nullish-literal-arm carry + decl-nullable + the narrow.js BIGINT-

      test/inference.js 'bigint∪null', all guard-liveness legs green).
      Buffer-family getters LANDED (d6c69fb: `.byteLength`/`.byteOffset`/
      `.buffer` runtime tag dispatch — BUFFER/TYPED → helper, else
      prehashed dyn-prop; proven receivers keep the static paths; pinned
      test/objects.js 'buffer-family'). The bare-getter hijack class is
      now CLOSED (.size 77331c4 + these three).
      Speed-tier throw: STILL OPEN, map sharpened to the end:
      * Payload decoded via a LAB-ONLY exported $__jz_err tag (recipe:
        ensureThrowRuntime push ['export','"__jz_err"',['tag',…]] in a
        scratch worktree + e.is/getArg in the harness): thrown value =
        f64 bits ZERO — the `(throw $__jz_err (f64.const 0))` family;
        with __num_radix's range guard and __bigint_from_str's digit
        guard as prime suspects ⇒ consistent with the misformatted
        "0.000…" hex string flowing into BigInt()/parse downstream. The
        toString misdispatch remains the root; the throw is its echo.
      * ORDERING FACT that killed the param-stamp plan:
        inlineHotInternalCalls (plan/index.js:86) runs BEFORE
        narrowSignatures (:125) — by lattice time the _i64Hex16/_i64Arith
        call sites are consumed (trace: 7004 sites, zero to either), so
        NO param fact can be derived from sites. Yet the final wasm
        keeps LIVE copies: $…$_i64Arith calls _i64Hex16(r) directly, and
        closures 2905-2913 call it with `local.get $__env` — CLOSURE-
        CAPTURED receivers. The remaining dimension is capture-slot
        provenance (closure env slots), not param lattice.
      * PRESERVED: scratchpad/bigint-provenance.patch (258 lines vs
        ce80bbe: kind.js bigintishOf fail-closed bigint∪nullish
        provenance query + emit dispatch consult + narrow post-settle
        weak-stamp w/ caller-param fixpoint + reps 'maybeBigint' +
        emitFunc merge). Compiles clean, L2 parity cs exact, does not
        yet heal speed (see closure dimension). Next session: extend
        provenance through closure captures (env-slot facts at
        resolveClosureWidth/emitClosureBody) or commit to the full
        nullish-union kind; then re-gate.
      * HYGIENE WARNING for next session: while the user's session is
        live, UNCOMMITTED main-tree work gets wiped by their editor/
        revert waves (lost twice today; index.js briefly de-paired from
        their assemble.js rename — repaired from the saved diff). Work
        in a scratch worktree branch; land only via prompt commits.
      LEVER-1 SESSION 2 (2026-07-12, probe chain in fix3-wt, all probes
      reverted): the "closure-capture provenance" framing DISSOLVED into
      a sharper, structural finding — the speed-throw is a CENSUS
      COMPLETENESS hole, and the fix needs NO new provenance machinery:
      * At narrow time the ENTIRE program contains exactly ONE
        _i64Hex16/_i64Arith call node (`_i64Hex16(r)` inside _i64Arith)
        — watr's FOLD2/FOLD arrow tables are NOWHERE: not in the module
        AST, not in any ctx.func.list body (raw included), closure.table
        still empty. The arrows leave the AST BEFORE THE FIRST
        collectProgramFacts (pre-inline census already shows i64=5 =
        only the non-arrow sites; the arrows' _i64Arith calls were never
        seen by ANY census). NOT foldStaticConstAggregates (scalar-only)
        and NOT pre-eval's foldNode (folds inside arrows, keeps them) —
        the exact siphoning pass is the ONE remaining unknown; next
        probe: trace which prepare/plan stage consumes the FOLD2 const
        decl statement.
      * At EMIT the arrows materialize as real functions (wat closures
        2905-2913) calling _i64Hex16 — so the runtime graph and the
        census graph DISAGREE. Two-level consequence: (a) _i64Arith's
        one real site is DROPPED by filterLiveCallSites (narrow.js:38 —
        roots are exported|valueUsed only; closure-materialized callers
        are invisible ⇒ _i64Arith "dead" ⇒ its interior site culled,
        [sites-i64]=0 at the lattice); (b) _i64Hex16.v gets no fact ⇒
        v.toString(16) unknown ⇒ number-fork denormal string ⇒ BigInt
        parse throw downstream (the zero-payload $__jz_err).
      * THE FIX (census altitude, two pieces): (1) whatever store holds
        pre-materialized closure bodies must feed collectProgramFacts as
        call-site sources — args like `BigInt(a)+BigInt(b) & mask` type
        BIGINT via bare VT with NO caller context, so the EXISTING val
        lattice + the landed nullable sweep then heal the entire chain
        (_i64Arith.r settles BIGINT+nullable → _i64Hex16.v settles via
        paramFacts → typed .bigint:toString — no bigintishOf needed);
        (2) filterLiveCallSites must seed closure-materialized functions
        as live roots (address-taken ≡ valueUsed). GENERAL WIN beyond
        the throw: today EVERY const-table closure's args are invisible
        to param inference program-wide — plugging it upgrades inference
        for all table-dispatch code (watr's PASSES/FOLD tables, jz's own
        emitter tables when self-hosted).
      * bigint-provenance branch (7b57dbb) stays parked: superseded by
        the census fix for this bug, but the bigintishOf query may still
        pay for receivers with NO call-site story; decide after the
        census fix lands.
      LANDED (2026-07-12, c4ef67f): the census fix — collectProgramFacts
      walks ctx.module.moduleInits for '()' sites (callerFunc=null; ~24
      lines + pin). The chain healed exactly as designed with ZERO new
      machinery: init-table args type via bare VT → _i64Arith.r settles
      BIGINT → _i64Hex16.v via paramFacts → typed .bigint:toString →
      the speed-tier lab row RUNS and the BENCH PARITY COLUMN PRINTS
      'ok' (cs=3935718203 == reference; -Os and L2 legs identical).
      Full gates at c4ef67f: suite 2774/2781 (the 1 fail = the known
      watr-5.3.6 drift item, user's upgrade lane), parity 9/9
      byte-identical, jessie cs=2418067300 EXACT @ ~2.24ms band,
      wordcount cs=2370237189 EXACT across V8/wasmtime/w2c legs.
      V1 FIDELITY MANDATE COMPLETE: jz-row parity 'ok' at speed tier.
      OWED: quiet-machine re-measure of the jz-row headline (this
      session's absolute times are load-noise — user session + builds
      churning; recorded quiet numbers predate the healed inlining
      path). Pin: test/inference.js 'census: const-table arrow args'.
      JESSIE LEVER RE-PROFILED (2026-07-12, production CPU profile —
      helper-counter profiling PROVEN MISLEADING for this: counter
      prologues inflate helper bodies, watr stops inlining them, and
      the instrumented build shows 4.09M __ptr_offset calls in
      functions whose PRODUCTION wat contains ZERO — profile the real
      binary with node --cpu-prof + wat-order index→name mapping,
      recipe in scratchpad/jessie-statics.mjs). True ranking (self
      time): closure5 13% (hottest single fn), parser workers
      (var$decl 7.9%, parse$id$10 6.6%), tramp_* closure-convention
      adapters ≈6.6% combined, __is_nullish 3.1%, __char_at 3.0%.
      Also: hashNode's 1.07M __length calls are OUTSIDE the timed
      region (bench times parse() only) — not a lever. The named
      lever: module-global CLOSURE devirt — the hot loop
      call_indirects through `global.get $m45_asi$baseSpace` with
      UNDEF-padded width args; source chain (subscript asi.js)
      `const baseSpace = parse._baseSpace ??= parse.space` +
      `parse.space = wrapper-arrow` — init-order-resolvable through
      function-namespace slots, values are module-scope ARROW
      LITERALS (no local captures). devirtGlobalCalls (plan/scope.js)
      already has the linear init env + poison + init-reachability
      soundness; its gaps: bare-fn-name-only RHS (needs arrow-literal
      lifting), no ??=/||= env handling, alias-const chains for the
      new value kinds. Worktree agent dispatched with the full design
      + gates (checksums exact, call_indirect 30↓, suite green,
      pins).
      LANDED (2026-07-12, a1c2ba0, agent-built + independently
      verified): devirtGlobalCalls resolves ??=/||= (prior-env-value
      wins — a resolved prior is always a function, non-nullish AND
      truthy; unwritten SROA global init = undefined atom), chained
      plain assignment one hop (`const asi = parse.asi = arrow`), and
      raw arrow literals LIFTED to named functions (fail-closed:
      plain params only, every free ident a module global/function;
      original arrow left in place for value uses). Poison scan
      widened to the house write predicate (ASSIGN_OPS + ++/--).
      RESULT: jessie call_indirect 30→21 (baseSpace ×2, baseStep,
      asi ×2, unicode id-alias ×4 — remaining 21 are the genuinely
      polymorphic Pratt operator table); jessie cs=2418067300 EXACT,
      wordcount cs exact, suite 2849/0, ratchets +0, interleaved A/B
      ~8.7% (2125→1940µs; independent re-run 2030µs — busy-machine
      caveat; quiet re-measure owed with the headline). Pins ×3 in
      test/closures.js (??= chain, chained-assign, arrow-lift with a
      live value-use proving closure.make survives).
      DEFECT FOUND BY THE AGENT (out of scope, differential-verified,
      NOT fixed): a REASSIGNED module `let g = arrow1; g = arrow2`
      (no namespace involved) silently calls the FIRST arrow forever
      (native 20, jz 15) — zero call_indirect involved, some direct-
      binding/inline path resolves the stale value; pre-existing,
      unaffected by the devirt change. MISCOMPILE CLASS — next named
      correctness hunt.
      KILLED (2026-07-12, 8e358a9): root = defFunc lifts EVERY depth-0
      arrow decl into a fixed NAMED function, sound only for immutable
      bindings — a reassigned `let g = a1; g = a2` froze callers onto
      a1 (module-level reassign → silently-stale value; in-function
      reassign → "'g' is not in scope", the write targeting a binding
      that no longer existed). Fix mirrors fn-namespace's multiProp
      demotion: a prepare-time scope-tracked pre-scan
      (scanReassignedTopLevel, stacked per module root) collects
      bare-name write targets (assign/compound/++/--, locals-shadowed
      writes excluded, declarator '='s excluded) and defFunc refuses
      the lift for any written name — the binding stays an ordinary
      closure-valued global (writable, indirect-callable), and the
      just-landed devirtGlobalCalls re-devirts init-order-resolvable
      cases. Gates: suite 2866/0 (the watr-drift item also gone —
      user's lane fixed it), jessie cs exact + call_indirect stays 21
      (zero accidental demotions on the corpus), wordcount cs exact.
      Pin: test/closures.js 'reassigned module function bindings stay
      live' (6 legs incl. shadowed-local non-demotion and the
      untouched-binding control).
      POST-DEVIRT JESSIE PROFILE (2026-07-12, load-tolerant relative
      ranking, cs exact, median 2011µs busy-machine): tramp_* GONE
      from the top table (devirt confirmed at runtime). Next threads,
      in order: (1) closure5 15.8% — the single hottest function,
      identify which subscript parselet it is and profile INSIDE it
      (real work, not convention now); (2) __ext_prop 2.4% — the
      HOST-EXTERNAL property fallback firing inside a pure-wasm bench:
      some dyn property read escalates through __dyn_get_any's
      external arm — find the receiver, likely an inference gap worth
      a class fix (and ~2.4%+chain); (3) flat parser-worker spread
      (loop$head 7.5, parse 6.1, register 4.9, var$decl 4.9) — no
      single lever, revisit after (1)/(2). Corpus checksum sweep +
      quiet-machine timing re-measure remain owed together.
      THREADS RESOLVED (same session): (2) __ext_prop = PROFILER
      ARTIFACT — a counting stub proves zero runtime calls (the 2.4%
      was V8 filing JS-side ticks under the import stub's frame);
      the external arm is dead in the bench, no defect. (1) closure5
      IDENTIFIED = a per-token parselet (loop-free 8K body, builds
      2-slot AST nodes, one parse$expr call) — its self-time is the
      INLINE NaN-box guard ladders on untyped closure ARGS. That is
      the closure-arg-typing problem previously BUILT AND REVERTED
      (dispatch-site arg lattice merged into element bodies'
      paramTypes — unsound because prepare's pre-eval erases element
      reads before program facts see them; revival needs a PREP-time
      escape record at the fold site, per the dispatch-lever-2
      entry). THE named jessie residual, a design item not an
      increment. jessie busy-machine ballpark now ~2.0-2.1ms vs V8
      ~1.5ms (≈1.35x, was 1.46x) — quiet re-measure owed.
      CORPUS SWEEP PAID (2026-07-12, --targets=v8,jz over all 52,
      busy-machine timings but LOAD-PROOF checksums): 51/52 jz
      checksum == reference — the ONE divergence is colorpq, the
      recorded correctly-rounded-pow accuracy hold; several cases
      show the ENGINE as the DIFF side (colorlog: jz is reference).
      SVG geomean: V8 2.16× slower than jz (was 2.09×). Self-host
      row: parity 'ok' IN THE REAL TABLE (cs=778190095 — the
      workload GREW with the user's Ring2/workers/generators
      commits); the sweep's 96.8ms jz time was a LOAD SPIKE —
      standalone rerun: jz 41.75ms vs V8 41.88ms, DEAD EVEN warm on
      the grown compiler (cold-lead headline still owed a quiet
      machine). Demotion fix exonerated: ZERO demoted bindings in
      the lab bundle.
      CLOSURE5 VERDICT (kills the '~25% closure dispatch' claim
      conclusively): it is subscript's DEDUPED SHARED UNARY-PARSELET
      body (`a => post ? (a && [op,a]) : (!a && (a=expr(p-.5)) &&
      [op,a])`) — the guard ladders ARE the semantics of `!a`/`&&`
      on genuine null∪node unions; arg-typing would remove almost
      nothing. Post-devirt the convention overhead is GONE
      (trampolines out of the profile); the residual 1.4× vs V8 on
      jessie is polymorphic-parser work where V8's ICs shine —
      closing further means IC-class speculative machinery in wasm
      (V2-scale idea), not a V1 lever. jessie stays the recorded
      lab-probe gap; the closure-arg-typing design item is DOWNGRADED
      from 'THE residual' to low-yield-for-jessie (still relevant for
      numeric-element dispatch shapes per the old entry).
      PER-CASE COUNT (same sweep): 48/52 jz BEATS V8 outright (was
      43/52 at the prior table). The four behinds, each with a
      verdict: self-host 2.68× = the proven LOAD SPIKE (standalone
      dead-even ⇒ effectively 49-50/52), jessie 1.44× (IC-class
      verdict above), colorpq 1.20× (accuracy hold), shapes 1.05×
      (noise band — recorded 0.89 LEAD on quiet). V1 bench mandate is
      at its practical ceiling pending the quiet-machine session.

## Floatbeat (what's a good name?)

* I want an environment like codepen, codesandbox etc, but specifically for sharing floatbeats with different visualizations;
* Search - to find floatbeats across different platforms (scraper? live pull? cache?)
* Various visualizers (via JZ or shaders)
  * Classic notes staff
  * Xenakis
  * log/mel spectrogram
* Interactivity - synth, midi, randomization, simulations
* An agent to help driving creation
* Music theory integration
* Audio metrics
* Output mastering params (maybe drop into wavearea for fragment editing?)
* Download a slice / fragment


## Ship — flagship (the one compounding "make-world-know" move)
- [ ] **Floatbeat playground** — type a formula, hear music; AudioWorklet, compiled live.
  Vibecoder + audio + live-coding proof in one. Needs: syntax highlight, waveform
  renderer, recipe-book/DB, samples collection, 1st class waveform, spectrogram etc renderers, artistic renderer (Chladni etc). Should be very easy way to share - likely compressed code in URL. Have to persist samples somehow (github gist like d3 blocks? Anything else?). The point is - audiovis playground.
- [x] **Playground site** = WAT-showing REPL; every item a shareable
  permalink. The demo *is* the marketing. Greenfield (no playground/ yet).
- [x] **Finish selfcompile** — template tag separate from main jz (real selfcompile); 3×
  cross-AI optimizer passes; **release 0.6.0**.
- [x] Main page
  - [x] Demo
  - [x] JZ/JS switch with fps
  - [x] Minirepl
  - [x] Mobile version
  - [x] Light theme?
  - [ ] Sponsor call
  - [x] Used by — color-space v3 ships its 27-space `color-space/wasm` backend built with JZ
- [ ] Examples
  - [ ] Each example must be a high-quality hero-screen-able configurable entertaing piece of art
  - [ ] Each example must be presentable to authors: lovely code editor, lovely settings panel,
  - [ ] Instead of myriads better have a few powerful boosted examples
  - [ ] Nice settings-panel side-menu
  - [ ] All math examples: educative, entertaining
  - [ ] Open in repl



## Reach — perception/proof (highest external leverage)
- [ ] **AudioWorklet + live in-browser REPL** — single highest-leverage move. Demos ship
  pre-built .wasm (looks like AssemblyScript's gallery); the differentiator (compiles
  in-browser) is invisible. rfft demo already has a source panel; ~30 lines (textarea →
  debounce → jz(src) → postMessage(bytes) → instantiate in worklet).
- [~] **unplugin-jz** — working prototype in `~/projects/unplugin-jz`: `kernel.js?jz`
  compiles import-free numeric exports to inline, sync-instantiated WASM; real
  Vite/Rollup/esbuild builds pass and webpack/Rspack adapters are exposed. Next:
  emitted-asset A/B, source-module graph, boxed-value interop.
- [~] **Dogfood own libs** — color-space v3 SHIPPED: 27-space `color-space/wasm`,
  import-free prebuilt JZ module with scalar↔WASM parity tests; README/site credit live.
  Remaining: digital-filter biquad, web-audio-api, fourier-transform.
- [~] **REPL** — ~~engine choice (porffor/awasm/jco)~~; download wasm; show produced WAT; auto
  var→let / function→arrow on paste; auto-import implicit globals; resolve npm packages (url);
  document interop.
- [ ] **Extism plugin path** — author Extism plugins in plain JS; underserved niche.
- [ ] **WASM-4 fantasy console** — supports AS/C/Rust/Zig/Go but no plain-JS path; cartridge
  = wasm start/update over a framebuffer = jz's shape. Viral, direct AS territory.
- [ ] **Subtractive subset spec** — a written acceptance criterion (PARSE-2 is exactly what
  one would have caught).
- [ ] (later) live-coding hosts (Hydra/Strudel/p5/canvas-sketch) — jz as the
  compile-your-hot-loop escape hatch. Pitch: warm kernel speed + tiny portable wasm, NOT
  cold-start (bench:startup: jz cold-start 200–1400× slower than `new Function`).
- [ ] vec4 package (unlocks SIMD); stdlib.io integration; glsl-transpiler.
- [ ] (later) dithering/convolution filters; water sim; text-layout algo; pinterest/fb-reels
  soundvis; math-formula soundvis; floatbeat reproductions.
- [ ] Enhance: settings-panel, palettes, meaningful UI/automation, inputs (file drops). Jukebox: more floatbeats, rotate (not random).

## Useful tools — returnable, not just demos
Wedge: compute behind an upload/paywall/install → run it local, free, private, instant.
jz = compute core, JS = thin UI shell. (full reasoning § ecosystem-audit.md "2A")
- [ ] **Audio workbench** (Tier 0 — own every piece) — decode → EQ/filter → effects →
  resample/convert/LUFS → export, AudioWorklet on jz kernels. Reuses audio-decode /
  digital-filter / audio-effect / pcm-convert / web-audio-api. **The useful flagship.**
- [ ] **QR generator/decoder** — Reed-Solomon + masking = pure integer, jz's floor.
- [ ] **Local image converter/optimizer** (PNG/JPEG/WebP/QOI + dithering) — Squoosh-class
  privacy wedge; reuses color-space.
- [ ] **Function plotter** ("compile your math") — `f(x,t)` → compiled → plotted.
- [ ] **Color/palette tool** (OKLCH↔hex, extraction, contrast/CVD sim) — reuses color-space.
- [ ] (niche) Voronoi stippler→SVG · bitmap→SVG tracer · pixel-art upscalers (EPX/xBRZ) ·
  cymatics/harmonograph/guilloché · WFC tile generator. (verticals, build on pull) quant
  (Black-Scholes/MC) · GIS (simplify/MVT) · fabrication (G-code/STL) · sci kernels
  (RK4/FFT/least-squares) · bioinformatics (alignment).
- [ ] **Demoscene / js13k / Genuary** — tiny wasm = sizecoding hook; same-source JS↔WASM =
  prototype-then-compile. Pouët, Dwitter/tixy.land, Lovebyte, JS13k, Genuary starter.

## Embedded — jz → native MCU (AOT, no interpreter — the honest differentiator)
Path: `jz → wasm2c/w2c2 → C → arm-none-eabi-gcc / esp-idf / avr-gcc → flash`. Unlike Espruino
/ Moddable XS / wasm3-arduino (interpreters on-device), jz is AOT-compiled to native.
- [ ] **Target matrix + f64 reality** — best on FPU MCUs (M4F/M7: ESP32, RP2040, STM32,
  Teensy 4, Daisy Seed); M7 has a double-precision FPU ⇒ f64 unpenalized; AVR no FPU ⇒
  i32-only kernels or out of scope. Document it.
- [ ] **Pure-compute proof** — `alloc:false`, no WASI, scalar kernel → C → flash → verify.
- [ ] **Flagship: biquad on hardware** — digital-filter biquad → jz → C → Daisy/Teensy audio out.
- [ ] **Heap + RAM budget** — pick a memory region; document RAM budget; w2c2 (~150 KB) runtime.

## Language coverage / correctness
- [x] **Extension-surface plan (2026-07-10 → CLOSED 2026-07-12)** — every ordered item
  landed; the plan doc (`.work/extension-surface.md`) is deleted, this entry is the
  archive. Start → close: language 1462/0 → **2331/0** (+ 2494 negative-rejects
  counted, 1551 silent-accepts tracked), builtins 719/12 RED → **737/0**, full unit
  suite **2864/0**. Permanently-out canon lives in README FAQ ("What will JZ never
  support"). What landed, in plan order:
  * [x] **Ring 0 — truth debt** (23 items): hypot n-ary, parseInt/parseFloat spec
    edges, regex `\p`-reject/`/y`-anchor/matchAll-TypeError, normalize, `**=`,
    per-iteration for-head `let` capture (copy-in/out, pay-per-capture), BigInt
    mixed-op rejects + literal-compare coercion, static call/apply/bind lowering,
    unknown-method-on-known-receiver compile error, JSON.parse reviver + replacer
    honesty, const-reassign guard, catch-param/var-for-of/assignment-form patterns,
    freeze/isFrozen consistency, strict-switch twin deleted, nullish for-of throws,
    predicate builtins carry real BOOL. Plus unblanketing-surfaced fixes:
    defaults-on-null, numeric pattern keys, var pattern declarators, cover-grammar
    for-of heads, stringify-replacer selfhost keyers (unsound SLP/CSE dedup in-kernel).
  * [x] **Runner honesty** — blanket skips split into named shape-skips; negative
    tests run inverted (correctly-rejected = own class; silent-accepts measured);
    TypedArray/RegExp/WeakMap/WeakSet/Error/import pools tracked; class dirs,
    generators/yield dirs, statics unblanketed as features landed.
  * [x] **Ring 2 — stdlib**: Array change-by-copy + of; ES2025 Set algebra (7);
    Object/Map.groupBy; named backrefs + RegExp.escape; Date toJSON/toDateString/
    toTimeString + branded 1-slot schema (fixed aux=0 aliasing corruption);
    structuredClone (arena deep-copy, cycles + diamonds); Math.f16round (exact
    round-via-addition, 200k differential); **Ryū String(number)** — spec-exact
    shortest round-trip, 3M-value differential vs V8, ~1.2KB pay-per-use;
    insertion-order Map/Set verified host-exact; lazy-table injection generalized.
  * [x] **Workers v1** — `sharedMemory` (real `shared` memtype), CAS `__alloc`,
    static region as passive segment behind `$__staticBase` (also fixed imported-
    memory garbage tables), module/atomics.js on proven Int32Array AND BigInt64Array
    receivers (runtime tag+elem guards; BigInt values enforced on i64), typed
    default-arg annotation seeds the param lattice, jz.pool over node
    worker_threads (i64-exact arg lanes; contended adds lose nothing; wait/notify
    handshake verified).
  * [x] **Generators** — regenerator-style state machines (no stack suspension):
    factory arrow + hoisted locals + dispatch loop; two-way next(v), return(v),
    throw(v) (closes + rethrows — no try may span a yield, so always unhandled);
    yield* delegation to any iterator (completion value threads); for-of over known
    generator calls fuses to while-next (pull-at-top — continue-safe); generator
    spread via fused toArray.
  * [x] **Iterator helpers as fused loops** — map/filter/take/drop stages +
    toArray/reduce/forEach/some/every/find terminals compose into ONE loop, zero
    intermediate iterator objects (the ES2025 flagship).
  * [x] **Class-adjacent Ring 1**: labeled non-loop statements; computed keys from
    module consts; pseudo-classical fold (`function P(){this.x=…}` +
    `P.prototype.m = fn` and `Object.assign(P.prototype, {…})` → class lowering;
    order-independent; arrow-RHS/ctor-reassign fail closed); static fields/methods/
    blocks (post-decl closure props + class-init-order blocks, `this`→class).
- [ ] **Extension surface — still open** (designs recorded here; the plan doc is gone):
  * **async/await** — parked BY VERDICT, not difficulty: state machine (generators
    built the machinery) + module/promise.js on a free NaN-box tag (5, 12–15 free) +
    microtask pump like timers (`host:'js'` setTimeout / `host:'wasi'` exported
    `__timer_tick`). Asyncify rejected (whole-module tax); JSPI rejected today
    (Chrome-only; breaks portable-artifact). THE open design: memory.reset() vs
    in-flight continuations (nursery arena for pending env cells, or a documented
    "no reset while pending" contract). Re-open on a real wedge (Extism/edge async
    host calls).
  * **Generator methods** (`class { *m() }`, `{ *g() {} }`) and **`using`/ERM** —
    parser-blocked UPSTREAM (subscript errors on the grammar); lowering is ready
    (generator machinery + try/finally). Land when subscript learns the syntax.
  * **Workers: browser pool leg** — jz.pool is node worker_threads today; the
    browser Worker shim needs a browser harness (web-qa or site demo).
    **Shared-everything** waits on the stdlib single-writer audit: relocation
    forwarding ptrs, STR_HCACHE lazy bit, object enum caches, hash growth — each
    races under true sharing.
  * **Relaxed-SIMD opt-in** (`relaxedSimd:true`) — watr encodes relaxed_madd FMA
    (the biquad/fft native-parity lever); breaks bit-exact valid-jz-runs-as-JS →
    flag only, never default.
  * **Float16Array** — elemType field saturated (3 bits + VIEW/BIGINT aux) and wasm
    has no f16 memory ops; software shims betray native-perf. Revisit when the wasm
    FP16 proposal ships. Math.f16round already landed.
  * **Known residue**: static-block own scope env (splices into class init —
    documented divergence, 3 skips); accessor-name/private-field/default-param
    reflection class families skip-classified; 1551 negative-accepts (early-error
    grammar a subset compiler doesn't enforce — measured per-dir, ungated);
    isArray-of-derived-promotion (12 xfails); mixed `??`/`||`/`?:` bool-carrier
    JOIN family (in-flight carrier work's domain); js-string-builtins deepening;
    memory64/multi-memory YAGNI until a workload.
  * **test262 headroom estimate (updated 2026-07-13)** — pool (1) LANDED:
    Atomics/SharedArrayBuffer/Iterator/Promise all tracked (builtins 973/0,
    language 2972/0 — see the coverage-pools record); remaining in that family
    is the $262.agent harness (112 files). (2) **generator dirs**: 543 skips —
    ~85 flat-dir files clear the generator arm yet die on later generic filters
    (harness includes, Symbol) — runner-honesty pass est +50–150; method syntax
    (55+) stays parser-blocked. `.throw()` skip lifted (stale — feature landed).
    (3) **class dirs**: 6.8k skips, dominated by descriptor/accessor reflection
    (permanently out); in-philosophy residue est +100–300 via narrowing the
    prototype/name-length blankets. (4) negative-accepts enforcement: honesty,
    not passes. Out-by-verdict pools unchanged: async family ~2.5k language +
    703 Promise, dynamic-import 997, for-await 1,142. Ceiling ≈ +0.5–1k passes
    on 3,068 today; the curve is flattening — remaining leverage is harness
    wiring + iterator values, not new syntax.
- [ ] **Date** — deterministic spec slices first; local-tz/Intl later. (deferred: object
  ToPrimitive coercion order; Date.parse until value-objects + UTC stringify exist. out of
  scope: local-time getters/setters, getTimezoneOffset, locale methods, toJSON, subclassing.)
- [ ] **Intl**; **test262** (know every fail by face — jzify or error cleanly, never fail
  unknowingly); **all AssemblyScript tests**; warn/error on memory-limit.
- [x] Tighten test coverage — randomly mutate features, see if tests break.
- [~] **jzify** — ~~converting script~~ LANDED 2026-07-12 as a first-class transform:
  `import { transform } from 'jz'` / `jz/transform` / CLI `--jzify` share one jzify/
  module with the compiler; synthetic PUA temps rename to plain identifiers on print;
  `{ onlyLowered: true }` returns null for already-canonical source (REPL auto-jzify
  on paste rides it — ⚙ checkbox, on by default; canonical pastes stay byte-intact).
  REMAINING: auto-import stdlib globals (Math.* → import math); then make jz core
  require explicit stdlib imports (remove auto-import); Crockford align.
- [ ] **Source maps** (blocked on watr upstream) — meanwhile add a WASM name section.
- [ ] **Math-kernel precision** — sin/cos/exp ~1e-9 absolute vs libm (~30-bit); filter-design
  math amplifies it (biquad `(1−cosω)/2` cancellation → ~1.3e-6 relative coefficient error at
  fc=1000/fs=44100; high-Q/low-fc pole placement sensitive). Lever: compile-time rational
  simplification (research.md) — carry `2πfc/fs` exactly, emit the cancellation-free form.
- [x] **Metacircularity** — extract a minimal jz parser from subscript (jz-jessie fork: no
  class/async/regex, ~30 lines); jzify uses jessie, pure jz uses the internal parser; true bootstrap.
- [ ] **Self-host-only miscompiles, open** (transplanted from the deleted groundtruth doc —
  neither is tracked anywhere else; both bite only the wasm kernel, host is fine):
  * bare `return;` sibling + i64-carrier boundary wrapper traps OOB at kernel runtime
    level 2 — `export let f = (x, c) => { if (c) return; return (x*1000)|0 }` inside
    compileAst; open tracker at test/parser-bugs.js:276.
  * src/ir.js `writeVar` emits invalid wasm in-kernel for `[a] = [7]` (destructuring
    ASSIGNMENT) and reassigned-param returns (`local.set expected f64, found i32.const`);
    three fix attempts failed to localize — the groundtruth doc's git history has the trail.
  * parked: SROA re-land (tag fix works natively, closures 89/0; miscompiles
    m5_parse$expr in the kernel bundle — needs a flatten stack-shape audit).
- [x] **WASI basic file IO — LANDED 2026-07-12.** `import { readFile, writeFile }
  from 'fs'` as a built-in module (module/fs.js), host:'wasi' only (host:'js'
  rejects cleanly: "wire fs via {imports} or compile --host wasi"). readFile(path)
  → string (jz strings are raw UTF-8 bytes — binary-lossless), writeFile(path,
  str). WAT: wasi path_open against the first preopen (fd 3, relative paths),
  fd_read loop into arena buffer (grow+copy), fd_close; iovec structs on the
  arena. jz's own wasi.js shim stays console-only — real FS comes from the
  actual WASI host (wasmtime, node:wasi); test via node --experimental-wasi in
  test/wasi.js. Sync by construction (WASI IS sync) — no event-loop breach.
- [x] **Closure-state visibility miscompiles — ROOT-FIXED 2026-07-13.** The
  whole pinned family (loop-minted-closure visibility, exported-closure
  siblings, optimizer closure-slot divergence, nested-harness drain) was ONE
  bug: when a module contains any dynamic key access (`x[expr]`), object
  literals mint with a props sidecar seeded per schema key (needsDynShadow),
  and __dyn_get probes that sidecar BEFORE the schema slots — but emit-assign's
  ptrAux and chained-receiver arms stored schema slots WITHOUT the __dyn_set
  mirror, so dyn reads served the stale mint-time copy (e.g. `p.then = closure`
  silently dropped subscriptions in the async runtime; delta-reduced from
  `Promise.all([p]).then()`). Both arms now honor the shadow contract; the
  three pins flipped to correct-behavior regressions; test262 asyncDone runs
  fully optimized; perf pins hold (ratchet 6/6, self-host warm 1.003×).
- [x] **Warm-kernel heap exhaustion from hex-table decode — ROOT-FIXED 2026-07-13.**
  Stdlib setup decoded hex tables with `s += String.fromCharCode(...)` per compile —
  Σ1..n ≈ n²/2 bytes of dead strings each time (full-range EL 10.4 KB → 54 MB/compile;
  math.js pow tables 2×6 KB → ~38 MB/compile, pre-existing). A warm no-_clear kernel
  instance (test/selfhost.js Map+prop stress) exhausted its heap after ~70 compiles —
  reproduced 3/3 with the EL table in-kernel, 0/3 without; the pre-existing pow-table
  cost is likely the same flake the corruption-hunt sessions chase. Fix: char-array +
  one join (linear) — module/number.js hexToBytes (EL + Ryū) and math.js powHexToBytes.
  Suite 21/21 ×3 with the fully-patched kernel.
- [x] **WASI reactor `_initialize` — LANDED 2026-07-13.** host:'wasi' shipped module
  init as a wasm `(start)` section, which the p1 ABI forbids calling WASI APIs from —
  a JS shim literally cannot serve them mid-instantiation (top-level console.log /
  Date.now crashed with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'buffer')"). Now
  init exports as the standard reactor `_initialize` (once-guarded; `run`/`_start`
  command wrappers self-init), jz/wasi + interop call it after memory wiring,
  node:wasi initialize() finds it natively, snapshotInit recognizes the reactor form
  (and stubs imports per import-module, so wasi_snapshot_preview1 hermeticity-probes
  properly). Raw instantiators must call `instance.exports._initialize?.()` (README).
- [ ] **EL-table size recovery** (full-range Eisel-Lemire costs 10.4 KB data on
  __to_num modules — golden pins re-baselined 9857→18335 / 14375→22856): derive
  the reciprocal (negative-exp10) half at __start via 256÷128 long division from
  the positive 5^q half instead of shipping it — ~8 KB data back for ~1 KB init
  code; entries are floor(2^k/5^-q), verified generator in scratch history.
- [ ] **Number/parseFloat >19-digit midpoints**: correctly rounded to 19
  significant digits (u64-exact + full EL); crafted 20-digit midpoint literals
  (const.wast 5.3575430359313371995e+300 family) need an arbitrary-precision
  slow path to disambiguate — watr's wasm-leg runner skip-carves them with the
  reason; implement big-decimal compare if a real workload ever hits it.
- [x] **Dyn-read gaps — BOTH FIXED 2026-07-13** (pins flipped to regressions):
  * string-INDEX assign of a schema key was the THIRD arm violating the
    shadow contract (emit-assign's literal-key indexed arm stored the slot
    without the __dyn_set mirror) — now mirrors like the dot-path arms.
  * "@@iterator method literal invisible post-init" root: the call-site `wasm`
    lattice counted an i32-lane POINTER argument as plain-integer evidence, so
    the callee's param narrowed to numeric i32 and reads widened the raw
    offset with f64.convert_i32_s (object arrived as a small NUMBER; every
    prop probe missed — Promise.any(obj) → __p_any → __p_list never saw
    @@iterator). argWasmType now reports the boxed f64 lane for pointer-kinded
    bare-name args; only applyPointerParamAbi (which stamps ptrKind/ptrAux so
    reads REBOX) may unbox pointer params. The 7 Promise.any iter-returns
    xfails pruned as passes — builtins 977 → 984 / 0 fail; perf pins hold
    (warm 0.997×, ratchet 6/6).
  * the reassigned-param residue — ROOT-FIXED 2026-07-13, TWO real bugs:
    (1) applyPointerParamAbi/applyTypedPointerParamAbi narrowed params to
    unboxed i32 offsets WITHOUT the body-write guard the wasm-type narrowing
    applies — a body reassignment stored a boxed f64 into the i32 local (wasm
    validation failure); both passes now skip body-mutated params. (2) VT['[]']
    typed ANY 2-arg [] read on a known array by ELEMENT kind — a non-numeric
    STRING-literal key ('@@iterator') is a PROPERTY read (undefined), so
    `a['@@iterator'] != null` folded TRUE and the drain guards called undefined
    (table OOB). Both kind arms now bail to unknown on non-numeric string keys.
    __it_drain un-dodged to the natural param-reassign form; regression pins in
    parser-bugs.js.
- [ ] **Self-host fragility guards, live** (from the deleted fragilities doc — each
  neutralized only at its one known trigger, unguarded in general): Root F `.typed:[]`
  runtime-variable OOB index unchecked (module/typedarray.js fast path — silent adjacent-
  heap corruption class; deferred pending in-bounds proofs); multi-prop spread
  `{...src,k1,k2}` HASH-vs-OBJECT result confusion (guarded only at narrow.js cloneSig);
  same-scope for-of loop-var shadowing in-kernel (unique names at trigger; inert twin at
  compile/index.js:572). Contributor-facing rule (ctx-literal field-set/order uniformity)
  belongs in CONTRIBUTING's vectorizer section when next touched.

## Bench-vs-V8+JSC matrix (2026-07-08 full-corpus sweep, all checksums identical)
vs V8 — trailing: jessie 5.4x (hard tail), immutable 1.83x, wordcount 1.63x,
shapes 1.08x (borderline). EVERY other case wins (40+ corpus).
vs JSC (new axis — jsc runs the whole corpus incl. compiler-class cases after
a43f8c0): trailing: jessie 6.9x, dispatch 3.1x (JSC's call_indirect tier is
far ahead — the br_table IC that beat V8 doesn't beat JSC), json 1.43x,
dict 1.34x, crc32 1.30x (JSC's int-loop wasm tier beats V8's AND jz's),
immutable 1.28x, strbuild 1.20x, synth 1.09x, qoi 1.02x.
jessie profile re-verified post-all-levers (counters): 3.7M dyn_get_t =
STRING-keyed dynamic reads (subscript tables keyed by token/op strings;
devirt can't fire — receivers are dict/unproven, not schema objects), each
paying dyn_get→dyn_get_t(str_hash 3.9M)→dyn_get_t_h(durable global-probe
ihash 2.1M + sidecar probe) + 8.1M ptr_offset inside those bodies. Levers:
(a) prove subscript's tables VAL.HASH at emit (direct __hash_get_local, kills
the 3-frame chain + durable double-probe) — needs cross-module type flow on
the table bindings; (b) shrink dyn_get_t_h's durable path (the
dynPropsFilterMissIR bloom already gates it — the 2.1M ihash hits mean the
filter passes; investigate why); (c) helper-internal fwd-free extracts.
WATR guardRefine BUG — FIXED UPSTREAM (watr 52b8c2c, needs publish):
restore() aliased the snapshot's inner neFact Sets into the live map;
an arm's addFacts mutated the snapshot; the second restore resurrected
the arm-local fact past the join → sibling tag compares folded on
one-arm facts (the vo valueOf miscompile). Fix: restore hands out fresh
Set copies. Regression test pins the leak shape. Cost of correctness:
kernel A/B 1.0097, jessie +2-4% (the bogus folds were deleting reachable
code). jz's AND-mask guard spelling (280e8f5) can revert to ptrTypeEq
after the watr publish if desired — both are correct now.
FALLBACK-ARM PROBE — REFUTED as a lever (probe-doubling on quiet machine:
±2% wash): the 473k fallback probes cost ~nothing; closure-props flat
table NOT worth building. cpu-prof leaf self-time confirmed misleading
for ihash (29ms 'self' vs ~0 causal marginal cost).
FRESH PROFILE (quiet machine, 4.3ms median, 3.12x V8 = V8 1.38/jz 4.30):
remaining time is GENUINE dispatch — closure8 19ms + trampolines 16ms
(~25% = jz's closure calling convention on the Pratt operator chain:
`(fn = lookup[c]) && fn(a, p)` indirect calls), __ptr_offset 8ms
distributed. NEXT CAMPAIGN: closure-call convention (devirt the
lookup-table dispatch: monomorphic-ish per charcode → inline cache or
direct-index call table; trampoline elision for arity-exact calls).
That is deep-structure work — start fresh with the harness+profile here.
RESTRUCTURE DONE (watr cd4f576 + jz f559b00): the table-entry-native-ftN
design landed as OPTIMIZER POLICY — watr `inlineWrappers` dissolves
adapter frames (closure-ABI trampolines, thin dispatch heads) by inlining
the target at the wrapper site; rides cfg.inlineFns at L3/speed. dispatch
+1-2% (3/3), jessie WASH, size +2%. KEY FINDING (3rd sampler correction):
trampoline 'self time' = irreducible f64<->i32 ABI CONVERSIONS + real
work, not frame cost. jessie's residual dispatch tax therefore lives in
the CLOSURE ABI ITSELF (uniform f64 slots force trunc/convert per arg per
call) — the next deep lever is typed closure ABIs (per-arity/per-type ftN
variants or i32-typed slots proven by the emitter), plus closure8's
genuine descriptor-walk work. The emit.js trampoline string-builder
(~3832-3896) stays as the fn-as-value ENTRY generator (still needed to
mint table entries; elision happens downstream) — its deletion is no
longer load-bearing for perf, only for taste.
TYPED CLOSURE ABI — REFUTED by measurement (4th sampler correction,
2026-07-08 night leg) BEFORE building it. Static: across ALL 85
call_indirect sites in jessie only 3 param-truncs + 2 call-site converts
are ABI-induced (the 140 trunc_sats are string/array INDEX conversions,
inherent to f64 numbers). Dynamic: 2.03M dispatches per bench run = 78k
per parse (arity histo: 0-arg 413k / 1-arg 900k / 2-arg 293k / 3-arg 93k
/ 4-arg 336k; W=8 => ~6.5 UNDEF pads per dispatch). Calibrated micro
(this machine, V8): monomorphic 10-arg call_indirect == 2-arg direct
(padding 0.013ns, indirection 0.008ns/call); POLYmorphic 8-target:
wide-indirect 2.24ns vs narrow-indirect 2.33ns vs br_table+direct
2.06ns. ANY per-dispatch mechanic saving is bounded +-0.2ns => 78k *
0.2ns = 0.02ms/parse; zeroing ALL dispatch = 0.17ms of the 2.9ms gap.
closure8/trampoline 'self time' is the work INSIDE (descriptor walks,
char loops), not call mechanics. V8 wasm call_indirect is ~2ns even
mispredicted. Do NOT build per-arity/typed-slot ftN variants for perf.
COMMENT-WRAPPER DISCOVERY (same leg): nulling subscript's comment.js
space wrapper (measurement-only arm-null, corpus has no comments) took
jessie 4462us -> 2451us: the wrapper was 45% OF TOTAL RUNTIME. Cause:
`for (s in parse.comment)` per space() call (15.3k/parse) — jz rebuilt
the key enumeration EVERY loop entry: receiver is a shadow-mirrored
schema OBJECT (cm[s] computed reads mirror schema into sidecar), so
emitEnumerateObject ran ihash global-probe + __coll_order(alloc+scan+
sort) + out-array alloc_hdr + dedup walk per token.
FOR-IN ENUM CACHE — LANDED (V8 EnumCache analog, all generic):
(a) core.js __hash_keys_ro: for-in over runtime HASH serves a 1-slot
cached boxed key array keyed (table off, live len); (b) object.js
emitEnumerateObject ro-mode: tier-1 returns the STATIC schema key array
(mkptr of __schema_tbl[sid] row) when both dyn sources are empty — zero
alloc, zero state; tier-2 caches the merged walk keyed (sidecar off,
sidecar len), checked BEFORE the ihash probe so a hit skips it too.
Invalidation (all cold sites): inserts miss naturally via len; HASH
genDelete clears unconditionally; __dyn_set global-arm insert +
__dyn_move + array headerPropsToGlobal clear; __clear resets (assemble
injection, gated includes.has). ro (for-in __keys_ro) ONLY — its result
is read-only by lowering contract; Object.keys keeps fresh arrays.
Shared memory: ro forced off (per-instance globals + no reset injection).
RESULT: jessie -16.5% (4471 -> 3750us, 5/5 interleaved under load-14);
counters: coll_order 15.5k/parse -> 0, alloc_hdr:space 15.3k -> 0,
ihash probes 36.9k -> 24.9k/parse. Suite 2712/0 (+5 enum-cache tests
incl. delete-then-insert stale-hole, 1-slot thrash, alloc-free pin);
opt0/opt3/wasi failure sets byte-identical to HEAD; _clear ABA test
(ephemeral dict at reused offsets across rounds) clean.
BONUS FIX riding along: emitEnumerateObject's durable-arm off-16 read
was UNMASKED (bit0 runtime-shadowed marker => misaligned sidecar reads
when enumerating a durable receiver with runtime props) — masked now,
matching collection.js's i64.and -2 protocol everywhere else.
PRE-EXISTING GAP FOUND (not mine, on HEAD too, noted for later): a LATE
literal-key write (`o['zz']=3` after construction) on a schema object is
INVISIBLE to for-in — the write lands somewhere enumeration doesn't
read. Repro in test/forin-deopt.js comment.
JESSIE NEXT LEVERS (by residual profile): (1) `parse.comment` read
itself — 15.3k/parse __dyn_get_any_t_h(parse-closure, 'comment' heap-str
key) through the t_h chain w/ 16.4k ihash probes (~0.3-0.6ms); note the
emitter picked the ANY variant for a LITERAL key (entry-point gap worth
a look) and a receiver+key->value 1-slot read cache would kill the rest;
(2) .loc sidecar alloc churn (hash_set 9.3k/parse on ephemeral nodes ->
slot-in-header idea); (3) closure8 descriptor walk (genuine work —
leaf-op costs only).
BEAT-WASM-OPT LEG (2026-07-09, fourth leg): DONE — geomean 0.998.
Two more watr passes landed on top of ifset:
- zeroinit (watr 59a0e3a): drop `local.set X (T.const 0)` when X provably
  still holds its spec zero (no earlier set/tee in program order incl.
  flat sibling forms, not inside a loop, params excluded). 42 sites on
  crc32 alone. BUG CAUGHT DURING DEV: float -0 === 0 in JS — an equality
  zero-test dropped `f64.const -0` sets and flipped the sign (jz's sort
  -0-before-+0 pin caught it); fixed with Object.is for f32/f64.
- ifset enabled at jz's SIZE tier (jz 32e32b8, watrIfset preset key):
  select IS a size win; wasm-opt -Oz does it too. Speed keeps it via
  boolConvertToSelect; DEFAULT stays branchy (pins).
Three stale codegen pins re-anchored PRE-watr (slice-view, Map/Set
refinement dispatch): the pinned DECISIONS are jz's, and watr's
inlineOnce now legitimately dissolves the single-caller helpers whose
names they grepped (zeroinit shrank bodies under the threshold).
WRAPPER PROBE-HOIST DESCOPED (analysis recorded): asi/comment scanners
call baseSpace through `parse._baseSpace ??= parse.space` — a
CONDITIONAL init write, so single-value closure devirt can't prove the
callee set and transitive-global-writes goes top. Would need ??=-aware
init-once facts (the value IS fixed post-init) — plan-phase work, ~0.1-
0.2ms of jessie at stake.
WALKER SWEEP RESULT: writesOf already memoized direct recursion;
remaining micro-specializations wash at wall-clock on this machine
(twice measured) — the real lever stays arrays-only walker variants /
per-pass fusion (design-level, recorded).
IFSET + PROBE-HOIST LEG (2026-07-09, third night):
WATR IFSET (watr 1f9b22c, jz 7fae21c): one-armed conditional update
(if C (then (set X V))) -> set X (select V (get X) C) — THE dominant
if-shape wasm-opt still converted in watr output. Speed-profile pass
(default off; jz maps it to boolConvertToSelect tiering — NOTE jz's
DEFAULT tier passes watrProfile:'speed' for outline/tailmerge, so the
explicit per-pass flag is load-bearing in both directions). nqueens -6%
(3/3). Gates: pure/trap-free/mem-free/typed-numeric V, ≤12 TOKENS
(count() counts tokens — a 2-op expr is ~8; the two-arm form's cap 6
was why it never fired on real arms), impure-cond clash check.
HEAD-TO-HEAD RE-MEASURE (the honest V1 metric): watr-as-optimizer vs
binaryen-as-optimizer on the SAME pre-opt input = 1.008 geomean (8
cases; watr BEATS wasm-opt on json 0.999). Chasing "wasm-opt finds
nothing on jz output" is a treadmill (smaller output gives binaryen
better input — measured 1.025->1.027 while jz shrank). Remaining
binaryen edge decomposed on crc32: ~90 stack-threaded local.sets
(SimplifyLocals-class dataflow) + ~40 extra inlined tiny-helper calls +
br/br_if forms. Those are the two named watr projects to flip <1.0.
PROBE-HOIST (jz 1da7b20): sidecar override probe hoisted to the entry
prologue for stable-global receivers (same proof as shape-1b); per-site
cost = one predictable i32 branch. jessie: 6 sites qualify (base
space/peek/linebreak scanners — the per-CHAR 3-frame probe is gone
there); asi/comment WRAPPER scans call baseSpace() so the conservative
only-charCodeAt-calls gate excludes them — EXTENSION: call-graph
"callee never writes global G" facts available at emit time (
collectReachableGlobalWrites has them but post-emit; needs a plan-phase
equivalent). jessie -2% directional (load-noisy); checksum exact.
PRE-EXISTING GAP FOUND (control tree too): `let cur = 0; cur = s;
cur.charCodeAt(i)` — a number-typed-by-init var later holding a string
mis-dispatches (vt=NUMBER wins over runtime NaN-box dispatch) →
charCodeAt yields undefined. Type-lattice unsoundness class; repro in
this note.
COMPACTION LEG (2026-07-09, second night): PASS-ABLATION METHOD — for
each optimizer pass, compile 50 benches + 66 examples + self-host kernel
with it disabled at speed/size/2 tiers; byte-identical output = dead.
DELETED (commits 0278309, 768748a): specializePtrBase (100% identical
everywhere — watr's inlining/offset folding subsumed it), sortStrPoolByFreq
(100% identical — its LEB128-ordering effect evaporated), deadStoreElim
(identical at size/2; speed: only nqueens ±8B and FASTER without it 3/3),
csePureExprLoop + the whole vestigial 'post' phase (unreachable: one
caller, always 'pre'). ~900 lines, dist/jz.js -9.5KB, dist/jz.wasm
-370KB, compile ~5-8% faster per corpus. KEPT with evidence:
cseScalarLoad (aos -25% without), hoistInvariantPtrOffset (shapes).
DEFERRED (need corpus bench-timing gates): hoistAddrBase (output 2KB
SMALLER when off — suspicious), hoistInvariantLoop-vs-watrLicm double
LICM, promoteGlobals, internStrings, propagateSingleUse (smaller AND
faster-compile when off), specializeMkptr, narrowLoopBound.
CHARCODEAT SHAPE-1B (274852e, 0a5e413): entry decomposition extended to
stable module-global receivers (parser shape `cur.charCodeAt(idx)`) with
an AST stability proof (never assigned in fn + only .charCodeAt calls in
body + no yield/await/new); probe fallback arm re-references bare-name
receivers so the ABI op sees the global.get. Honest: bench corpus
byte-identical (no bench has the shape), jessie WASH — the per-char
METHOD-OVERRIDE PROBE dominates that site now; its answer is loop-
invariant under the same proof → HOIST THE PROBE is the named jessie
lever. Learned: self-host kernel compiles the compiler's own source —
structuredClone in abi/string.js broke the kernel build (fixed).
V1 ARCHITECTURE CAMPAIGN — MEASURED STATE (2026-07-09 leg; all four
selected items now have causal numbers + ranked levers):
(A) jz.wasm vs V8: warm self-host geomean 1.004x jz.js (sort 0.97,
mandelbrot 0.98, crc32 1.00 already BEAT; mat4 1.06 lags), fresh 1.097x.
The V1 item is a mat4+fresh-instance problem, not a strings problem.
(B) produced-wasm size: jz size-tier is 1.026x geomean of wasm-opt -Oz
APPLIED ON TOP (8-case corpus) — i.e. 97.4% of binaryen's ceiling.
Residual decomposed (crc32 disassembly diff): ~60 if->select conversions
(wasm-opt: if 240->180, select 5->37 — most of the bytes, also a speed
win) + ~87 locals stack-threaded away (set 293->206). Both are
well-defined watr passes: `ifToSelect` (arms pure+cheap+non-trapping)
and cross-block set/get threading. Land those upstream -> jz output
BEATS wasm-opt and 'internalize the optimizer' is done.
(C) compile speed: bottleneck MOVED — emit phase now dominates
(base64: emit 43ms vs watr 16ms of 68ms; blur 37/33). CPU profile
(30x base64): watr's generic tree walkers = walk 679ms self + walkPost
356ms ≈ 30% of ALL compile time (megamorphic callback per node incl.
leaves); biggest single callback was tallyLocals (329ms) — SPECIALIZED
upstream (watr e83c858, direct monomorphic recursion, outputs
byte-identical on the 48-bench corpus) — wall-clock wash under load,
keep and re-measure quiet. NEXT: same specialization for the remaining
hot pass callbacks (writesOf 83ms, cseFactsOf 92ms, hashFunc 138ms,
substGets), or the deeper fix — arrays-only walker variants (half of
all nodes are leaf strings/numbers that most callbacks reject first
thing). jz-side emit: ir.js walk 95ms + countsOf/writesIn ~106ms.
(D) jz.js size /2: dist/jz.js = 1.59MB minified (3.5MB source).
Composition: src/optimize/ = 629KB source (vectorize.js 369KB +
optimize/index.js 251KB) — the single biggest block, ~19% of dist.
THE architectural fold matching the V1 item text: migrate jz's
post-watr WAT passes + vectorizer INTO watr (one optimizer, one walker
infra, one convergence loop) — deletes ~600KB source from jz, ends the
duplicated pass machinery, and consolidates where (B)'s new passes land
anyway. Next-biggest: emit.js 218KB, collection.js 169KB (WAT-string
stdlib — candidate for extraction to a precompiled artifact?).
PRE-EXISTING FIXED EN ROUTE: examples/bench.mjs interference harness
called removed update() (frame() since 5e7df87).
LEVER (1) SOLVED AT THE ROOT (next leg, same night): not a cache — the
existing fn-namespace SROA (flattenFuncNamespaces) was promoting ONLY
multiProp slots (prepare's registry = top-level `f.prop = arrow`
re-lifts). parse.comment (single ??= dict write), parse.newline/semi
(reassigned only INSIDE arrows — invisible to prepare) therefore stayed
on the __dyn_get/__dyn_set probe chain per token. The `any` variant for
a literal key was a red herring — _h IS the prehashed literal-key entry.
FIX (scope.js decision loop): every prop of a non-disqualified namespace
dissolves into a module global EXCEPT the single-top-level-lifted-arrow
shape (kept as-is: its calls lower to direct `call $f$prop`, a global
would demote them to call_indirect; never-value-read ones still drop).
RESULT: jessie 3700 -> 2210us (-40%, 3/3 interleaved; checksum equal).
SESSION TOTAL with enum cache: 4430 -> 2210us (-50%); at the recorded
quiet-machine V8 1.38ms this is ~1.6x V8 (was 3.12x). The asi/comment
wrapper state (newline/semi/comment) is now plain global get/set.
TRAMPOLINE TAIL-CALL — probed, WASH (3/3 interleaved ±1%): return_call on
the plain-f64 forwarders doesn't move jessie because the HOT trampolines
(tramp_parse$space$5 12ms) are the i32-RESULT case — they rebox
(f64.convert_i32_s (call ...)) and cannot tail-call. THE REAL FIX doubles
as the architecture simplification the trampoline deserves: compile
function-as-value TABLE ENTRIES natively against the uniform ftN ABI
(one compilation with the ftN head: read params from slots, rebox result
inline in the body's return) instead of tramp-forwarding — deletes the
60-line trampoline string-builder in emit.js (~3832-3896), removes the
extra frame for ALL result types, and unifies closures + fn-as-value
under one table-entry convention. Direct-call sites keep the exact-sig
entry; whichever is unused treeshakes. Substantial emit restructure —
own session. closure8's 19ms self is genuine descriptor-walk work
(subscript dispatch()) — only leaf-op cost reduction helps there.

JESSIE CAMPAIGN STATE (end of 2026-07-08 leg): 5.4x -> 2.88x V8
(same-thermal-window pairs; V8 2.09ms, jz 6.01ms). Landed, all generic:
array-index element semantics (7c42b30), string-primitive props semantics +
durable runtime-shadowed bit (70585fd), primitive-receiver method-override
probe skip (280e8f5, -13.5%). Next levers by current profile: residual
ihash 39ms (428k legit shadowed probes + 473k fallback-arm closure-prop
reads -> closure-props flat table keyed by fn index), .loc sidecar alloc
churn (115k __hash_new_small/run -> slot-in-header), closure8/trampoline
dispatch (22ms self, genuine Pratt work -> devirt/inline-cache territory).
WATR BUG ROOT-CAUSED TO MECHANISM (2026-07-08 late leg, upstream-pending):
guardRefine ALONE miscompiles (not a composition — {guardRefine:true} on
defaults flips the vo repro to tag=1). Mechanism: its tagAlias/neFact maps
mis-associate across REUSED/COALESCED locals — bisected to fold #7
(i32.eq($..._type,ARRAY) -> 0) whose neFact was derived from cond
i32.eq($__inl19_arr0, 1) where arr0 is a coalesced slot holding a TAG at
that point but tagAlias bound it to a source local ($__inl18_a) that was
REASSIGNED in between; the fact then applied to the new occupant. Suspect
surface: restore(pre)/killLocal(writes) discipline around if-arms vs
walk-order of coalesced defs. Artifacts: scratchpad/vo.prewatr.wat
(deterministic 176KB repro: optimize({guardRefine:true}) -> exports.f()
tag 1 instead of 4), scratchpad/vo-run.mjs (tag checker + minus-one-pass
bisector), scratchpad/pre-gr.wat (pre-guardRefine stage, fold site at
line ~5077). Instrumentation recipe: cap folds via WATR_GR_MAX + log via
WATR_DBG_GRN/WATR_DBG_FACT (patch shapes in the session transcript).
jz-side: the AND-mask tag-compare spelling (280e8f5) avoids the trigger.
TIME PROFILE (2026-07-08, --cpu-prof on names:true jessie wasm — the call
COUNTS above were misleading; counts ≠ time): __ihash_get_local self=94ms
of ~270ms total wasm self-time (35%!), __dyn_get_t_h 24ms, __str_hash 14ms.
The dyn_get_t key chain was eliminated (array-index element arms, 7c42b30 —
attribution shows ZERO chain calls) and jessie wall time did NOT move: the
chain was calls, not time. THE REAL SINK: subscript stores parse.space/
step/enter/exit/id AS PROPERTIES ON THE PARSE FUNCTION (a CLOSURE), and
closures have no off-16 header sidecar — every parse.step/space read
(1.6M+/run, const-key _h path) probes the global __dyn_props int-hash
(CLOSURE → global-table arm in __dyn_get_t_h; the 1-slot dyn_get cache
thrashes between parse's ~6 hot props receivers/keys). NEXT LEVER (the
generic-baseline fix): give closure receivers a header props slot (allocate
env with an off-16 sidecar like OBJECT/ARRAY, or a dedicated props cell in
the closure env) so closure-prop reads take the header-sidecar path — kills
the global probe + its cache pressure. Alternatively a receiver+key inline
cache at _h const-key call sites (monomorphic in this workload). Expected:
the full 94ms ihash + part of dyn_get_t_h 24ms ≈ ~40% of jessie runtime.
Note: .loc writes (115k/run) allocate a per-node __hash_new_small — the
allocation churn is the secondary sink to check after closure props.
RECEIVER IDENTITY SOLVED (offset histogram, self-learning slots): the
durable-arm receivers are STATIC-DATA objects at offsets 33..126 (the
preeval'd subscript tables — NOT closures, NOT strings) plus a long tail:
first-8 slots each saw count=1 with 1.96M in "other" ⇒ hot-set cardinality
≫ 8 (why the 4-way shared cache lost). A STRING+'length' short-circuit in
__dyn_get_t_h (landed below in this tree? NO — measured a wash, keys are
NOT 'length'; kept anyway? see commit) did not reduce the 1.07M probes.
THE DESIGN THAT FITS ALL FACTS — per-receiver "runtime-shadowed" bit:
reads on durable receivers must probe the GLOBAL table first only because
a runtime write may shadow the init-time sidecar. Mark shadowing AT THE
RECEIVER: __dyn_set's durable-global route ORs bit0 into the receiver's
off-16 props word (HASH ptr offsets are 8-aligned ≥16 — bit0 is free; a
0 slot becomes 0x1 = shadowed-no-sidecar). The read path loads off-16
ONCE (it needs it for the sidecar anyway): bit0 clear → sidecar only,
ZERO global probes (the 1.07M reads are exactly this class); bit0 set →
global probe (guard __dyn_props root ≠ 0 first — after _clear the root
is 0 and a stale marker must not probe a null root) then sidecar. _clear:
markers go stale (global wiped) — harmless with the root≠0 guard (one
wasted branch until re-shadowed); no healing needed. Exact, per-receiver,
no aliasing, no shared-cache eviction, O(1). Also verify whether the
1.07M probes are HITS or MISSES first (one counter): if mostly HITS the
runtime writes genuinely live in the global table and the win is smaller —
then attack the WRITE side instead (why do subscript's tables take runtime
writes? parse.js:86 \`prec[op] = ...\` placement decides).
CAUSAL CONFIRMATION (probe-doubling, 3/3 interleaved): duplicating the
durable-arm __ihash_get_local call costs +2.7-3.0ms median (+30%) — the
1.07M probes really are ~31% of jessie runtime; the cpu-prof self-time was
RIGHT and the 4-way cache loss (below) is a mechanism failure, not a
mis-attribution. Open puzzle for the next design: why did a 4-entry cache
lose while the probes cost 2.8ms? First measure receiver CARDINALITY
(histogram $off in the durable arm) — if the hot set is >4 (e.g. many
durable receivers with NO global props each caching a 0-sentinel and
evicting each other), the cache needs to be receiver-SIDE instead: cache
the global-table resolution in the durable receiver's own off-16 header
slot at first runtime read (headers are durable; the cached ptr is
ephemeral → needs _clear healing via the existing __durable_slot_log
machinery). That converts the probe to one header load, per receiver, no
shared-cache eviction at all.
4-WAY RECEIVER CACHE — REFUTED (built + interleaved-measured): extending
the 1-slot dyn_get cache to 4 slots (both arms, rotate-evict, dyn_set
matching-slot update, _clear resets) made jessie +8-11% SLOWER, 3/3
interleaved pairs. The 1-slot cache already serves the hot closure receiver
in one compare; the durable-arm __ihash probes are evidently far cheaper
than the cpu-prof self-time suggested. CAVEAT for the whole 94ms reading:
V8 sampling attribution for tiny hot leaf wasm functions is suspect —
re-verify with a counted-cycles harness (helperCounters + wall-time deltas
from selectively nulling arms) BEFORE the next dyn-path surgery. Exact
ihash call split (jessie-attrib3): 1.07M durable-arm + 473k fallback-arm
cache-miss + 398k direct (space_5 Map op) + 127k dyn_set.
LEVER-(a) SCOPING (2026-07-08 probe, scratchpad/dict-micro.mjs): a LOCAL
module-level `let d = {}` with only-dynamic uses ALREADY lowers to
__hash_get_local_h/__hash_set_local — the dict inference exists for simple
bindings. So the 3.7M dyn_get_t receivers are NOT the prec/operators dicts
in the simple case; they're either (i) the EXPORTED table bindings
(subscript `export let prec = {}` — export/cross-module refs may defeat the
inference; verify with the real jessie module graph), or (ii) schema'd
objects taking dynamic reads through the durable __dyn_props global. NEXT
STEP is attribution, not new inference: compile the jessie bench with
helperCallsites:'dyn_get_t' (or helperCounters + per-fn callsite filter)
and read WHICH functions/receivers drive the 3.7M — then pick (a) vs (b).

## Bench-vs-V8 campaign (2026-07-08 state — from 7 losers to 2 modest + 1 hard)
Cool-machine sweep 2026-07-08: shapes 1.11x, immutable 1.69x, wordcount 1.77x,
strbuild 1.07x, dispatch 0.89x WIN, dict 0.85x WIN, json 0.60x WIN,
jessie 5.3x (the hard tail: helper-internal probe bodies). colorpq's parity
column is NOT a regression signal — its checksum hashes raw f64 bits of
Math.pow outputs, jz's own pow polynomial can never bit-match V8's
transcendentals (no gate assertion exists for it; perf ~1.18x).
Landed this leg: 5c2de02 (lazy per-string hash cache: wordcount 1.91->1.7x,
kernel A/B 0.986), d35bba1 (devirt sid-cache + discriminant collapse + tee
hoist: shapes 3.9->1.11x, immutable rode along), 2365e36 (in-place
replace-stores via whole-program alias sweep: immutable 3.2->1.7x).
WASM_TODO in test/bench.js carries the per-case lever notes (vs wasm rivals);
this list is the V8-specific gate.
- **colorpq — CLOSED to 1.20x** (f9caa74): fractional const-global reads now fold
  to literals at readVar (only ints were cached), so emitPow's constant-exponent
  arm fires (pow → inline exp(c·log x)) and the PPC vectorizer pairs into TRUE
  2-lane log_v/exp_v. 38 runtime-pow calls → 0; 113.6→69.9ms, checksum unchanged.
  Residual 20%: scalar tail + sign-select; possible fused exp2_v(y·log2_v x)
  kernel saves the ×ln2 round-trips. Note: watr cse can't dedupe across INLINED
  copies (per-splice temp names differ) — rename-aware GVN is the general answer.
- **strbuild — flipped to 0.978x** (rode the const-fold).
- **dispatch 1.17x** — one call_indirect over a CONST 8-arrow table, data index.
  The AOT answer: watr devirt resolving f64.load(static_addr + idx*8) against the
  DATA SEGMENT (const fn-array = baked closure boxes) → br_table over 8 direct
  calls (bounds+sig checks gone; tiny bodies then inline). Seed machinery: the
  5.2.2 hoisted-index devirt. Same class as `shapes` tag-switch.
- **dispatch — CLOSED to 0.925x** (d9418b7): const-fn-array indexed calls lower
  to br_table of direct calls (AOT polymorphic IC), call_indirect default arm.
- **wordcount 3.8x — DESIGNED, ready to build**: helper-counter profile shows the
  RMW `counts[w] = (counts[w]|0)+1` pays EVERYTHING twice (str_hash 14.0M = 2/op,
  dyn_get 6.8M + dyn_set 6.8M, str_eq 6.6M). Fix the CLASS: fuse `o[k] = f(o[k])`
  (hash-typed receiver, pure o/k, rhs reads same key) into ONE probe:
  1. kernel: `__hash_slot(coll i64, key i64) -> i32` — genUpsert's exact machinery
     (grow + zombie probe + insert-on-miss, value seeded UNDEF) returning the VALUE
     SLOT ADDRESS. Sound because the BOX never changes across growth (forwarding
     header; __ptr_offset_fwd resolves) — genUpsert already returns coll unchanged.
     Return 0 on type-guard fail -> caller falls back to generic dyn_set.
  2. emit-assign arm: detect `['=', ['[]', o, k], rhs]` with rhs containing
     structurally-equal PURE `['[]', o, k]`; emit kT/oT once, slotT = __hash_slot,
     bind old = f64.load(slot) to a temp, substitute the rhs reads with the temp
     NAME (readVar picks the local; `|0` ToInt32 of UNDEF box -> 0, semantics
     preserved), store result to slot, yield it. Expect ~2x -> ratio ~1.9.
  Then: heap-string hash memo (words recur 6.8M times over 512 objects).
- **wordcount — CLOSED to 1.77x** (b013782 then 5c2de02): dictionary-mode {} +
  fused RMW `o[k]=f(o[k])`, then the lazy per-string hash cache
  (STR_HCACHE_BIT: concat/append/slice-materialized strings allocate
  [hash=0][len][bytes], __str_hash fills the cell on first hash — 2.19M cache
  hits / 183 cold fills per run; bump-extend mutators zero the cell).
  jessie counter-verified INDIFFERENT (hit=0 — all its non-SSO hashing is
  interned statics). Residual vs V8: probe-loop + str_eq constant factors.
- **shapes 3.6x — DESIGNED**: schema-set devirt at property reads. New
  program-facts lattice: per-param/binding CANDIDATE SCHEMA SET (monotone union,
  bounded <=16, poison on overflow — extends the existing single-sid
  inferSchemaId/arrayElemSchema facts). Emit `o.x` with a schemaSet fact as:
  sid = aux bits of the box -> br_table over candidate sids -> arm = direct
  f64.load(off + slotOf(schema_k,'x')*8) or UNDEF when schema_k lacks x ->
  default arm = generic __dyn_get (alien schema, always sound). Same toolkit as
  the dispatch devirt (d9418b7): bounded candidates + br_table + generic default.
  ~6 ops/read vs the ~50-op megamorphic __dyn_get_any_t_h probe; 23 sites in the
  bench. Bench guards reads by `o.k`, so arms are dead-branch-prunable later
  (flow refinement), but the flat switch alone should close most of 3.6x.
- **shapes — CLOSED to 1.11x** (2159fa6 then d35bba1): schemaId br_table devirt,
  then receiver-stable sid cache (a never-written receiver's sid is constant —
  compute `sid|-1` once, entry-hoisted select for ≥2 reads / inline for 1;
  -1 wraps u32-huge into br_table's default so the tag guard is free) +
  discriminant-field collapse (prop at the SAME slot in every schema →
  `(u32)sid < count ? load : generic`, no dispatch — o.k was a full
  megamorphic probe 37.7M times/run, THE dominant cost) + pure-tee hoisting
  (foldSetToTee/cse tees in call operands extracted to standalone sets so the
  hottest read no longer bails the purity check). kernel A/B 0.997.
- **immutable — CLOSED to 1.69x** (2365e36): in-place replace-stores landed
  exactly per the spec below; residual is the guarded load + V8's young-gen
  cache warmth. Sweep + emit as designed, plus two spec deltas discovered
  in the field: (a) node identity AND enclosing-function name don't survive
  plan→emit (body transforms + emit-time inlining splice frames), so sites
  are content-keyed `receiver|flat-literal` with a program-wide meet;
  (b) exported functions have no paramReps — elem facts derive from internal
  call sites (zero internal callers ⇒ host-only ⇒ marshaled copies can't
  alias). Pinned in test/inplace-store.js (fires+bit-match, alias-after-store
  rejected, leaked-element rejected, runtime-alien falls back).
  ORIGINAL SPEC (implemented): in-place replace-store
  `arr[i] = {lit}` overwrites the old element's slots instead of allocating,
  when a whole-program sweep proves no alias can observe it. Design:
  (1) SWEEP (new src/compile/inplace-store.js, called post-narrow from
  compile/index.js when facts are final): walk every function; for each
  element-read site R on an array whose elem could be a schema object (skip
  NUMBER/typed-elem arrays via arrayElemValType/typedCtor facts): classify R
  as (a) immediate `.prop` receiver (atomic, safe), (b) init RHS of a
  single-decl binding whose uses are ALL MEMBER_R (field reads — record
  (fn, sid) alias), (c) anything else = LEAK -> poison sid (unknown sid ->
  poison all). Candidate stores: statement `arr[i] = {staticLit}` where
  repOf(arr).arrayElemSchema == sid(lit) and all lit values NUMBER (durability:
  no eph pointers stored into durable receivers). Candidate valid iff sid
  unpoisoned, every recorded alias (fn', sid) has fn' == candidate's fn
  (a cross-function alias could live across the call into the store's fn), and
  within fn every alias binding's LAST use precedes the store statement
  (positional walk; aliases are per-iteration block-scoped so next-iteration
  reuse is fresh). Emit `ctx.schema.inplaceStores = WeakSet<literalNode>`.
  (2) EMIT (emit-assign.js, new arm before arm 7): spill lit field values to
  f64 temps IN SOURCE ORDER (they may read the old element: swap case); spill
  eT = emit(arr[idx]) box; guard `(bits(eT) & HI_MASK) == OBJ|sid prefix`
  (OBJECT_SCHEMA_HI_MASK pattern, emitSchemaSlotGuarded, module/core.js):
  fast arm -> f64.store old slots from temps, result eT (same box IS the new
  object — array store elided, identity preserved); else arm -> __alloc_hdr +
  slot stores + mkPtrIR(OBJECT,sid) from the SAME temps + existing
  storeArrayPayload (OOB/UNDEF/alien-schema elements all land here ->
  bit-exact generic semantics). Wins: kills 131k allocs/pass (6.3MB heap
  churn -> 0, cache-warm 4096 objects); identity change unobservable because
  the sweep proved no live alias.
- **jessie 5.0x — PROFILED** (per run: 8.1M ptr_offset, 4.1M dyn_get_t_h chain
  + 3.9M str_hash, 2.1M ihash_get, 1.1M alloc each ENTERING __memgrow). Chain-
  frame flattening (skip __dyn_get/__dyn_get_t for proven-string keys) measured
  ZERO — V8 wasm calls are cheap; the cost is INSIDE: probe+eq bodies, per-read
  str_hash, and __ptr_offset's forwarding-follow branch 8.1M times. Real levers,
  in order: (1) receiver-stable offset caching — subscript's dispatch tables
  never move; hoist __ptr_offset out of read sites per receiver (the existing
  hoistGlobalPtrOffset class, extended to locals/params); (2) string hash memo
  for heap keys + prehash literals at parse-table BUILD time; (3) __memgrow
  call-per-alloc — move the grow check inline into __alloc's fast path.
  Each is kernel-wide (helps jz.wasm compile times too, not just the bench).
  LEVER 3 DONE (a633659): __heap_end byte watermark — jessie 8765->8500us,
  kernel A/B 0.976. Lever 1 refined: the 8.1M ptr_offset calls live INSIDE
  helper bodies (dyn_get_t_h's receiver+sidecar resolves) — jz-site hoisting
  can't reach them; needs either a generation-stamped receiver cache in the
  helpers (extend __dyn_get_cache_*) or fwd-free inline extracts for the
  never-forwarded kinds (OBJECT, string keys) with the follow only for HASH.
  Lever 2 refined: __str_hash already caches interned heap strings (off-8) and
  fast-mixes SSO; the gap is runtime-BUILT heap strings never get interned —
  intern-on-first-hash (insert into the intern table when STR heap key first
  hashes) gives every later hash the cached read. jessie keys are mostly SSO,
  so this lever belongs to wordcount's 7-8 char words more than jessie.


## Arch analysis triage (compile time / size 2x — RE-RE-RANKED on 2026-07-08 frozen-sim evidence)
MEASURED (crc32 @speed, warm, 9-run median): full compile 95.3ms; with
optimize:{watr:false} 23.1ms — **watr's optimizer is 72ms = 76% of compile**.
jz-side optMod:optimizeFuncs is 14ms (secondary), pullStdlib parse 1.3ms,
watrCompile encode 2.9ms, everything else ≤3ms.
(1) **build-time-compiled stdlib — REFUTED by direct simulation.** Two probes
    (scratchpad sim-bake.mjs / JZ_SIM_FROZEN crude-frozen hack): (a) splicing
    stdlib bodies pre-optimized to watr's function-local fixpoint changed
    watOptimize 72.1→67.2ms (1.07x) with near-byte-identical output; (b) a
    full "frozen" sim (dirty-seeded rounds + module/finish passes skipping
    std funcs) saved only ~4-9ms on crc32 AND json. Root cause: the cost is
    WALK+user-work, not std-work — inlineOnce dissolves stdlib bodies INTO
    user funcs, so their nodes get optimized under user labels regardless
    (json frozen profile: r1-r3 propagate:USER = 28ms). Identical input
    bodies ≠ skippable work; the work product is program-specific. Compile
    ÷4 does not exist here; ceiling ≈1.2x for heavy bake+frozen machinery.
    (Bundle ÷2 via template replacement is a separate, weaker, still-open
    size idea.) Foundation facts kept for the record: pre-watr stdlib bodies
    ARE 34/36 cross-program byte-identical (116KB); post-watr only 22/26.
(2) **watr optimizer engine is the re-ranked lever** (frozen-sim profiles,
    instrumentation patch: scratchpad/watr-prof-instrumentation.patch):
    - [x] propagate walk fusion — LANDED watr bbcb318: substGets logs writes
      during its own recursion, killing the 4 extra full-subtree walks per
      statement (clone+equal, sibling staleness, known-map staleness,
      writesMemory). Output byte-identical corpus-wide + kernel.
    - [x] size-guard encodes — LANDED watr bbcb318 (`guard: false` opt) + jz
      speed presets (`watrGuard: false` → watrOpts.guard). L2/size keep the
      never-inflate guard. Byte-identical on the corpus (guard never unwound).
    - Combined measured: watOptimize crc32 78→58ms, json 110→97, raytrace
      74→61, wordcount 114→96; END-TO-END compile crc32 99→85ms (1.17x),
      json 158→140 (1.13x), raytrace 130→112 (1.16x), wordcount 163→136
      (1.20x). Kernel A/B 0.9949 (kernel embeds watr → compiles faster too).
      Activates when watr >5.2.3 publishes (option is a no-op on 5.2.3).
    - [x] cse memoized bottom-up facts — LANDED watr da24c0e. O(n·depth)→O(n)
      collection; byte-identical; kernel-module optimize ~1%, medium neutral.
    - [x] inline simdOnly prefilter — LANDED watr b06ff0c (2-5ms/module).
    - [x] SELFHOST BUILD: watrGuard:false in scripts/selfhost-build.mjs —
      kernel watOptimize is 70s of the 83s build; the guard's two encodes of
      the 6.6MB kernel = ~12s (CPU profile: instrSize 7.4s + localidx 2.2s +
      codeItemSize 1.0s + idx helpers). Build 83.4s→69.6s. Kernel +3.7KB
      (+0.06%, the inflation the guard used to revert); kernel A/B 1.0055 =
      sub-noise; selfhost 20/20, pins/goldens green.
    - [x] convergence hash — LANDED watr 7c5a093: hashNode (53-bit rolling
      structural hash, zero allocation) replaces hashFunc's full serialized
      string in runRounds; token stream replicates hashFunc exactly (export
      skip, L-canonicalization) and was differentially verified (zero verdict
      mismatches, kernel + corpus). +2-5% medium modules.
    - dedupe per-round key memo — REFUTED: WeakMap(contentHash→canonKey)
      memo was neutral-to-worse on kernel AND medium modules; funcs churn
      every round (propagate/coalesce rename), so the memo misses and pays
      hashNode on top. Same churn argument likely kills the tallyLocals
      memo idea. NOTE: kernel byte drift across watr edits is EXPECTED —
      the kernel embeds watr's optimize.js as module m122; only behavior
      divergence matters (differential harness pattern in scratchpad).
    Remaining (kernel profile, self-time — the honest column; totals for
    recursive fns are analyzer-inflated):
    - walk/walkPost visitor overhead 17s/70s kernel — the structural floor;
      specialization territory (per-pass fused walkers). Diminishing-returns
      territory: remaining kernel cost is genuine work on ~6k churning funcs.
    - tallyLocals (countLocalUses) 2.9s kernel — per-func recount each
      propagate entry per round; see churn caveat above.
    - coalesceLocals in rounds ≈24ms/module — REFUTED removing it from
      rounds (crc32 −4.5ms but json/wordcount +6ms, size wobbles): it earns
      its keep mid-rounds. Win must come from making it cheaper, not rarer.
    - inlineOnce candidate scan 7-9ms/module.
    These are generic engine fixes (help every watr user + every jz tier).
(3) watr encoder local-decl grouping — DONE jz-side (sortLocalsByUse).
csePureExprLoop/cseScalarLoad stay — prototypes for the watr CSE port
(pure-call CSE landed upstream 6e659de; local-alloc gap vs wasm-opt open).

## Compiler backlog — deferred-on-no-workload (YAGNI: build when a real bench surfaces the shape)
All ranked-ROI optimizer items shipped (Archive); since then extending-add (`f5213cb`),
scalarization cap 32→64 (`087dc56`), and the dead-code/interop hygiene tail also landed —
moved to the 2026-06-16 drain entry in Archive. What remains is speculative — adds
correctness risk for zero measured benefit:
- [ ] **Stdlib-pull audit** — walk `module/*.js` for builtins emitting a polyfill where
  wasm-v1 has a native op / cheap fold (the `**0.5→sqrt` win, generalized). Gate on the
  builtin actually appearing in a kernel. Owner: module/math.js (+ siblings), test/math.js.
- [ ] **Representation carriers** (design: .work/research.md) — jsstring internal-locals flow;
  boundary string cache (interop.js, by identity); schema-object field packing (i32/ptr, not
  f64-tag); typed-array element rep (auto Int32Array backing); closure-capture narrowing (i32
  cell, not nanbox). Each blocked on a converging carrier fact + no current workload;
  regression risk > theoretical win.
- [ ] **form-normalization folds** (lint) — `parseInt(intLit)` fold; `x=x` drop; `s+""` drop
  (only when statically STRING); `no-useless-return`. DCE-adjacent; defer until one is hot.
- DON'T chase (refuted/calibrated): PS-3 wasm-opt slack gate (matches measured); OPT-B/C
  (watr-off only fires when optimize==null; vectorize is L2-default + opt-out-able). Size
  reality: hand-WAT 3–8× smaller is structural (generic helpers); realistic ≈1.5–2× with
  `alloc:false`+`optimize:'size'`, NOT byte-parity.

## Future
- [ ] Component interface (wit).
- [ ] **threads/atomics** — lower `Atomics.*` on shared typed arrays → wasm atomic ops;
  `memory:{shared:true}` → shared Memory + `(memory … shared)`; worker spawn stays host-side
  (same boundary discipline as I/O). Large; verify a real workload first. Vectorizer +
  shared-memory substrate already exist. SCOPED 2026-07-10: v1 plan + missing-pieces +
  single-writer audit list archived under Language coverage → "Extension surface —
  still open" (typed-array-SPMD v1 landed 2026-07-12 and dodges the stdlib audit).
- [ ] memory64 (>4GB); relaxed SIMD; WebGPU compute shaders.
- [ ] **wasm-gc backend** (`host:'gc'`) — orthogonal multi-month backend rewrite (engine GC +
  typed refs); benefits memory-model / externref / debugging, NOT boolean discrimination
  (landed carrier resolves that in wasm-v1). Reserved error today (index.js:315).
- [x] **Insertion-order Set/Map** — landed: a monotonic insertion seq rides the free high 32
  bits of each entry's hash word (seqStore, module/collection.js); __coll_order sorts live
  slots by it for every iteration surface. Verified host-exact incl. delete+re-add (moves to
  end), overwrite (stays), and rehash (order survives the grow copy). Pinned in test/data.js.

## Ideas
  - [ ] webpack/esbuild/unplugin — extract & compile fast pieces with jz.
  - [x] jz as a compilation target — DSLs emitting jz-compatible code get WASM for free.
  - [x] template tag as a build tool — jz`code` in a Node script replaces a build step.
  - [ ] AS integrations/plugins (assemblyscript.org/built-with);
  - [ ] potrace playground.
  - [x] dithering algorithms — `examples/dithering` (threshold/Bayer/Floyd–Steinberg/Atkinson over a shaded sphere).
  - [ ] EdgeJS test/harness entry — only if it runs in their CI without large/optional deps.

## Demos / visualizers: ideas for no-gpu graphical uses

  - [ ] Screensavers
  - [ ] NFT
  - [ ] Instagram minimalism/etc renderers
  - [ ] xor shaders
  - [ ] Demoscene
  - [ ] winamp visualizers
  - [ ] Various (classic) audio visualizers
  - [ ] Wave osc visualizers
  - [ ] DAW play visualizers (pitch bend etc)
  - [ ] Musical visgens (windchimes, physical etc)
  - [ ] ASCII renderers
  - [ ] SVG visualizer?

## Archive

### Extension surface — coverage pools (2026-07-13) — CLOSED

All four remaining pools wired at 0 fail; the extension surface within jz
philosophy is complete. Final: **language 2,972 / builtins 977 — both 0 fail**
(combined 3,949 of the 53.6k corpus; every exclusion skip-classified by name).

- **Promise 703 → 127 pass.** $DONE shim ported to test262-builtins.js; runtime
  gained allSettled/any/try/withResolvers, plain-object thenable adoption
  (already-called latch, 25.4.1.3.2), executor abrupt→reject, resolve identity,
  non-callable then-handler pass-through, __p_list GetIterator (non-iterables
  reject TypeError). 7 iter-returns xfails observe the @@iterator dyn-read
  KNOWN GAP (live item).
- **Iterator 514 → 75 pass.** Helper results are first-class VALUES —
  helper-using programs mint generator objects through __it_mk (map/filter/
  take/drop/flatMap + terminals, value+counter callbacks, callable guards,
  ToNumber'd limits, IteratorClose through flatMap, no `return` on indexed
  mints); `instanceof Iterator` shape probe; Array.from → __it_arr;
  `[lit][Symbol.iterator]()` → __it_from. Fusion kept its zero-cost path and
  gained spec counters, reduce no-init seeding, bool-kinded some/every.
- **Language async-generator/for-await → +178 (2794→2972).** async function*
  lowers to the SAME sync machine with TAGGED yields ({a:1}=await, {a:0}=yield)
  driven by __ag_run (serialized next(), yielded values awaited per
  AsyncGeneratorYield, yield* over async/sync/indexed sources); `for await`
  desugars to plain awaits and works in plain async fns. The ~1.2k dstr-head
  files absorb as v1 skips by design.
- **Atomics 390 + SharedArrayBuffer 104 → 24 pass.** `new SharedArrayBuffer(n)`
  canonicalizes to ArrayBuffer (sharedness is a jz.pool LINKING concern, not an
  object property); Atomics ops work on views over buffers; buffer `.slice()`
  gained spec index clamping (__clamp_idx — negative wraps, clamp to length).
  **$262.agent verdict (final):** all 112 agent files include atomicsHelper.js —
  host-object reflection machinery (patches methods on the $262 host object,
  .bind, this.setTimeout, Date.now) — the family jz sheds by design; the
  CAPABILITY (cross-thread atomicity, contended RMW, wait/notify blocking,
  BigInt64Array i64 atomics) is proven end-to-end by test/workers.js over
  jz.pool (workers block in Atomics.wait, main notifies, 4/4 woken, 4×1000
  contended adds lossless). Skip reason names this verdict.
- **En route, the biggest win of the effort:** the pinned closure-state
  miscompile family turned out to be ONE emit-assign shadow-contract bug —
  root-fixed (see the ROOT-FIXED record in Language coverage / correctness);
  test262 async runs fully optimized, perf pins hold (ratchet 6/6, self-host
  warm 1.003×).

### .work plan docs audited & deleted (2026-07-12) — five deep-dive audits vs live code

**preeval.md (2026-07-02→07-07) — CLOSED.** Tier 1 (pure-expression folding incl.
BigInt-rational round-once arithmetic: `0.1+0.2-0.3` folds to exactly 2^-55) +
Tier 3 (module-init snapshotting) both landed: `src/prepare/pre-eval.js` +
`src/prepare/math-kernel.js` (21 bit-exact transcendental mirrors) behind
`optimize.rationalConst` (default on), pinned by test/preeval.js (27 tests);
`src/snapshot.js` (`optimize.snapshotInit`) proves init hermeticity DYNAMICALLY
(instantiate with throwing host stubs) — supersedes the doc's sketched static
initFacts consumer — bakes __start's heap image as data, 3208 globals, verified
no start section in dist/jz.wasm, ships by default in the self-host build.
Tier 2 (static object/array trees → data segments) never built — still the open
tier. Follow-ups worth doing: mixed string+number `+` fold is now UNLOCKED (its
exclusion cited kernel-vs-host String(number) divergence; Ryū closed that
2026-07-12) — fold it behind the same rationalConst gate; no fuzz harness for
the Rational/math-kernel arithmetic itself (only directed tests); jessie/watr
ecosystem-perf caps still opt-in (`JZ_ECO_PIN=1`, test/ecosystem-perf.js);
rationalConst's literal-fold divergence absent from README FAQ divergence list.

**load-cse-design.md (2026-06-22) — RESOLVED, increment #2 obsolete.** Increment
#1 (index-disjoint load-CSE) shipped same-day as `src/compile/cse-load.js` — an
AST pass hooked post-type-inference (compile/index.js:536), NOT the WAT-level
pass the doc argued necessary (stale conclusion; the simpler sound hook point
won). Pinned test/perf.js:796; verified live: fft RE[a] 3 reads→1 load, IM[a]
3→2 (the predicted same-index boundary). Both motivating benches won by OTHER
levers: mat4 beats rust-wasm 1.58× via hoistReductionInvariantsIn; fft is a
statistical tie (residual was FMA parity, not IM[a]). distinctParams shipped but
feeds cross-iteration LICM (raytrace's win), not same-iteration reuse. Revisit
increment #2 only if a kernel needs same-index cross-array load reuse; `A[i-3]`
subtraction-shaped offsets remain unmatched (cheap, no workload).

**ast-tagged-union-plan.md (2026-06-21) — PARKED with evidence.** Full 10-phase
integer-op-tag migration was BUILT once end-to-end (dual-keyed dispatch, byte-
identical corpus, self-host clean), then measured: op-tag dispatch ≈0.4% of
compile time — not the bottleneck (watr's per-compile hash teardown was, fixed
separately) — and the transitional diff deliberately reverted. Kept: dormant
seed `src/ops.js` (OP/OPS enum + internOps, zero importers, zero cost) + the
runbook in git history. Do not resume phases 1-9 absent a native-backend
trigger where integer jump-tables pay. Confirmed still fully dormant.

**selfhost-fragilities.md — 10/13 FIXED with guards+tests** (Root A/A′ dyn-set
arms, Root B tblConsumed, Root D promotion disqualifier, __obj_clone,
__clamp_idx deps + the selfhost-includes.js structural invariant, vectorizer
ctx-shape unification, getter dispatch registry, Eisel-Lemire __dec_to_f64,
bench-selfhost fresh-instance); Root C/E were non-issues. THREE LIVE (also
recorded under Language coverage → correctness): (1) Root F — `.typed:[]` fast
path is genuinely unchecked for runtime-variable negative/OOB index
(module/typedarray.js; deferred pending the in-bounds-proof extension; the
SAFETY framing — self-host codegen must fail loud, not corrupt silently — is
distinct from the user-facing unchecked-reads principle); (2) multi-prop spread
`{...src,k1,k2}` builds HASH while readers assume OBJECT — neutralized only at
narrow.js's hand-built cloneSig; (3) same-scope for-of loop-var shadowing
miscompiles in-kernel — neutralized via unique names at its one trigger, a
second inert instance sits in analyzeFuncForEmit (compile/index.js:572).

**selfhost-perf-groundtruth.md (2026-06-19→07-08) — SUPERSEDED** by this file's
own "jz.wasm beats v8" thread (which carried the campaign to byte-parity + V8/
JSC-dead-even warm). Every landed lever/root-cause is preserved as inline
comments at its fix site. Its TWO never-fixed self-host-only miscompiles moved
to Language coverage → correctness: bare-`return;` i64-carrier OOB
(test/parser-bugs.js:276) and ir.js writeVar kernel-invalid-wasm; plus the
parked SROA re-land note (flatten stack-shape audit; miscompiled m5_parse$expr
in-kernel). Doc deleted; git history retains the full diagnostic trail.

### Verifier-surfaced deopts (absence-of-overhead gates, not benches)
The structural-invariant verifier (`test/wat-invariants.js`) sweeps the fuzzer's
i32-disciplined sublanguage and flags any f64 / un-hoisted pointer op inside a loop —
waste the net-output bench can't see. Two real gaps it surfaced, now ratcheted so they
can't worsen and visibly shrink when fixed:
- [x] **Nested-conditional int narrowing + dead `__static_str` pull** — CLOSED (13 → 0).
  Two fixes: (1, prior) toI32 distributes ToInt32 through `(if result f64)` recursively, so
  nested integer `?:` chains narrow to `(if result i32)` (13→2). (2, this round) the last 2
  residuals (typed-int seeds 28, 73) were NOT user-loop deopts — a mixed number/boolean
  ternary `(c ? num : num>k)` lost type precision (`VT['?:']` returned null when branch
  kinds differed), so the enclosing `+` emitted the polymorphic string-concat dispatch on
  pure-numeric operands, pinning the whole number→string formatter (`__str_concat` →
  `__to_str` → `__static_str`, all f64 dtoa loops). A pure-int program ballooned 1 → ~19
  funcs. Fix: `VT['?:']` (src/kind.js) now mirrors the `&&`/`||`/`??` BOOL-coercion rule —
  a boolean branch coerces in numeric context, so `num ? : bool` carries the non-bool type.
  Repro `a[i] = ((a[i]-((a[i]<=2)?a[i]:a[i])) + ((a[i]===255)?a[i]:(a[i]>2)))|0`: 19 → 1 func,
  no `__static_str`. Verified: scalar fuzz 4000 / typed-int 1000 / typed-map 600 × opt{0,1,2,3}
  all 0 divergence. Gated: test/wat-invariants.js `absence:` (no number→string formatter in a
  pure-int program) + typed-int sweep promoted to hard-zero.
- [x] **Param typed-array base re-decode** — DONE (speed tier). A typed array passed as a
  PARAM (`(buf,n)=>{ for(i<n) buf[i]=f(buf[i],i) }`, JZ's flagship DSP shape) re-decoded
  its NaN-box base every iteration because the polymorphic store reassigns `buf`, marking
  it unsafe to hoist. `unswitchTypedParamLoop` now tests `is buf Float64Array?` ONCE before
  the loop → a base-hoisted f64.load/store fast loop the lane vectorizer lifts to f64x2;
  every other type falls back bit-exact (test/unswitch-typed-param.js). Speed-only (it
  duplicates the body — size↔speed). NB: the perf-ratchet `buf` baseline (3861) measures
  optimize:2, where the param path stays dynamic by design — it does NOT drop when the
  speed-tier win lands (vectorization RAISES static op count); the win is pinned
  structurally, not by op count. At 'speed', 34/40 buf-corpus programs vectorize (0/40 at opt2).
- [x] **narrowLoopBound `i <= n`** — DONE. Surfaced by the AS-canon bias audit; factorial
  (`for i=2; i<=n; i++`) kept a per-iteration `f64.le(convert(i), n)`. Now snaps the bound
  via floor with a NaN→I32_MIN guard (`trunc_sat(floor(NaN))=0` would wrongly run i=0;
  JS `i<=NaN` is false → 0 iters). First hardened test/fuzz.js with `fuzzLoopBound`
  (param-bounded loops over NaN/±Inf/-0/fractional — the CONSTANT-bound generators never
  covered this), THEN extended the pass (src/optimize/index.js). Pinned:
  test/wat-invariants.js `<= narrowed` ablation + fuzzLoopBound (3000 seeds green).
- [x] **narrowLoopBound: SCEV-shaped counters (bench/sieve `i*i`)** — DONE. `for (i=2; i*i<LIMIT;
  i++) for (j=i*i; j<LIMIT; j+=i) …`: `i*i` is f64 (the integer-overflow contract), making the
  outer bound, the inner counter `j`, and the index chain f64. New plan-phase pass
  `narrowBoundedSquare` (src/compile/loop-square.js) rewrites `i*i` → `Math.imul(i,i)` (→ i32.mul)
  when the guard is `i*i </≤ CONST` with CONST ≤ 2³⁰ (literal OR a module const via
  ctx.scope.constInts — the bench's `1<<20`) and the IV is +1-incremented and not otherwise
  mutated. The inner `j` cascades to i32 on its own. SOUND incl. the EXIT-OVERSHOOT trap (i*i
  computed before the `<` test can exceed 2³¹ for larger bounds): ≤ 2³⁰ keeps the exit product
  < 2³¹, so `Math.imul == i*i`. Verified bit-exact vs JS incl. the 2³⁰ boundary (iteration-count
  loops, no 4GB array) + 100k-sieve (9592 primes); soundness boundaries pinned (bound 2³⁰+1 /
  variable / non-+1 step / mutated IV all stay f64). Pinned: test/loop-square.js. The AS-canon
  audit now PASSES (sieve cleared). Off at L0 / `loopSquare:false`.
- [x] **Pipeline under-converges on vectorized reductions** — DONE (hot-path). The post-phase
  lane vectorizer (runs AFTER fusedRewrite's memarg fold) emitted `v128.load/store (i32.add
  base K)` for the unrolled multi-accumulator reduction, keeping a per-iteration i32.add per
  accumulator. Fix: `foldV128Memargs` runs right after `vectorizeLaneLocal`
  (src/optimize/index.js), folding K into `offset=` — same logic/soundness as the scalar
  MEMOP fold. dot loop-body 84→72, sum 94→88; the fixpoint audit is now 10/10 LOOP-body
  fixpoints. A REJECTED global cleanup-pass alternative (don't re-try) over-reshaped loops +
  cost compile time; the targeted fold is surgical. The residual whole-module deltas the
  audit shows (dot −6, clamp −8) are watr `brif` (block+br_if→if/then, SPEED-NEUTRAL) +
  module-level inlineOnce that jz deliberately skips — not hot-path waste (audit now
  classifies real-vs-neutral loop ops). Stencil test made robust to the fold (test/simd.js:
  `!/v128.store/` instead of the stale `!/v128.load offset/`). Verified: all typed fuzzer
  modes × opt{0,2,3} 0 divergence; full suite green.

### Examples polish pass + 2 new demos + a per-pixel-color miscompile fix (2026-06-19)

A sweep through the gallery for correctness, interaction and perception, plus the one real
compiler bug it surfaced. Each example bit-exact JS⇆jz where applicable; browser-verified.

* [x] **domain-color rendered solid black under jz** — root cause was a `tryPerPixelColor`
  miscompile, NOT the example: `let fx=0; if(denom>ε){fx=…}` lifted `fx` to an f64x2 lane local
  (splat 0) while the statement-form `if` landed in the SCALAR epilogue, so the lifted
  `hypot(fx,…)` — emitted before the epilogue — read the stale splat(0) → all-zero. Fix:
  `tryPerPixelColor` now bails to scalar when a lane local is re-written in the epilogue AND
  consumed by another lane (`src/optimize/vectorize.js`); rewrote the kernel to an unconditional
  safe-denominator divide (vectorizes correctly + poles flare white); de-vacuumed the example test
  (it called `frame(0)` where both paths were coincidentally zero). Regression pinned in
  `test/simd.js` (`COMPLEX_FIELD`, proven to fail without the bail).
* [x] **Stale wasm** — fern / attractors / bifurcation shipped `.wasm` from before the last
  compiler commit; rebuilt (fern is actually faster in jz). **bifurcation** also had auto-SIMD
  *hurting* its memory-bound `Math.log` tonemap → replaced with a precomputed LUT (bit-exact, par
  with V8, no harmful lift). **ising** "looked like noise" — dynamics were fine, the default T just
  sat at/above Tc; retuned to start cold and breathe across Tc so domains nucleate visibly.
* [x] **Fractal family pan/zoom** — julia drag→pan + c auto-morphs on the 0.7885 circle; newton
  gained view params, drag-pan and an auto-swirling `a`; buddhabrot uses a decaying accumulator so
  the nebula refines into the new view instead of flashing black; apollonian fixed a genuine
  geometry bug (central Soddy circle's curvature wrongly folded in the outer circle → it *crossed*
  the inner circles; now `k₁(3+2√3)`) + its dead pan (double-normalized `ptr.x`).
* [x] **Misc** — cradle: positional rigid-chain constraint so dragging a middle ball *pushes* its
  neighbours; phyllotaxis: smaller dots; ulam: re-walks the whole spiral per frame (meaningful ms,
  ~30× faster reveal); wireworld: randomized layout from canonical parts, pure-black bg, **pencil
  tool** (drag to draw per-pixel conductor wire, right-click sparks an electron); chladni: framed
  with green x/y standing-wave strips (the components it superposes) + note readout.
* [x] **Two new examples** — `dithering` (one shaded sphere, four 1-bit dithers) and `hydrogen`
  (|ψₙₗₘ|² electron clouds in phase color, cross-dissolving 1s→…→4f). Registered in `examples.js`
  with thumbs + wiki links.


## Marketing / landing-page — audience-driven (full research → `.work/marketing.md`)
Goal = **real adoption** (kernels shipped with jz), channel = **page + repo only** (README/npm/page
ARE the distribution). Personas to optimize the page for: **#1 Web-Audio/DSP authors (highest fit,
currently invisible on the page)**, #2 JS-library authors (blocked by "fits my build?"), #3 creative
coders (already over-served — don't add more). Ignore for the page: edge/JS13K/Porffor/compiler-curious
(reachable but low real-adoption conversion). Verified: hero toggle is an honest **11.8×** jz win
(grid-current frame, 6×2000 @1360×560) — safe to lead with it as proof.

Done this pass:
- [x] **Meta description bug fixed** (`index.html`) — was "beats Rust and Zig → wasm" but bench
  targets are NATIVE (`rustc -C target-cpu=native`/`zig -O ReleaseFast`) and jz loses 7/20 Rust cases.
  → "Over 2× faster than V8, trades blows with native Rust and Zig". (drops the drift-prone 2.4× too.)
- [x] **`<title>` → SEO-first** — "jz — JS→WASM compiler for numeric code (DSP, audio, math)".
- [x] **H1 → benefit/persona-first** — "Your numeric JS, compiled AoT to WASM" (kept your `<br class="hb">`
  + AoT; avoided "native-speed" as a slight overclaim — let the metrics/live demo prove speed).
- [x] **FAQ +3 entries** — "Does it fit my build pipeline?" (honest no-plugin-yet), "What JS semantics
  differ?" (f64 / UTF-8 bytes / no-GC + link), "Can I debug it?" (console.log / --names / --why-not-simd).
- [x] **Footer copy de-duplicated** (FIXME resolved) — "The slow 10% … the other 90% stays the JS you wrote."
- [x] **npm `description` + keywords** broadened (numeric, signal-processing, audio-worklet, math,
  js-to-wasm, performance) — `jz` is unsearchable, so metadata carries discovery.
- [x] **README first-screen hook** — use-cases + no-annotations/no-lock-in above the fold.
- [x] **GitHub repo** — description set; topics filled to the 20-cap (+numeric, signal-processing,
  audio-worklet, js-to-wasm, math, performance, functional). Social-preview image still TODO (manual).
- [x] **bench/README.md credibility fixes** (verified from results.json): callback 27.56×→2.26× (was
  10× off), tokenizer "AS wins" (FALSE — jz now 0.84×), aggregate "smaller than AS" (FALSE — jz ~1.1×
  larger) + V8 0.41→0.43 / AS 0.40→0.36, audio showcase refreshed (blur 9.4×, bytebeat 3.7×, synth→2.0kB),
  poly 6.2→12.9×, json 1.7→1.3×, summary ranges, watr "only case"→+jessie, +alpha honesty bullet.
- NOTE: **hero sub left as-is** (your terser rewrite + `.sb` hook) — NOT overridden. Recommendation
  stands: foreground "valid jz is valid JS / no lock-in" + name DSP in the sub; your call.

Next — page LAYOUT (yours; ready-to-paste markup handed over in chat):
- [x] **Caption the JS/JZ toggle**: "Same source. Flip to compile it to WASM." (strongest proof; unlabeled = decoration).
- [x] **Move `npm install jz` chip into the hero** (`.pleft`, under the sub); wire its copy handler like `install2`.
- [ ] Name the AudioWorklet use case with a real DSP demo above the fold (biquad/minisynth + toggle).

Next — repo:
- [x] **Finish bench/README.md regeneration** — biquad/mat4/bitwise/aos/mandelbrot/sort/crc32 per-case
  tables are still an OLDER snapshot (mostly UNDERSTATE current jz). Best fixed by a generator
  (`scripts/bench-readme.mjs` reading results.json): `npm run bench` would DROP zig/go (not installed)
  and degrade results.json, so regenerate the doc FROM results.json, don't re-run the bench.
- [x] **GitHub social-preview image** (manual upload via repo Settings → every shared link unfurls with the pitch).
- [x] Stop hardcoding the speed multiple in static copy — meta fixed; in-page metric prefills are
  live-bound from results.json (self-correct), so left as-is.

(The two highest-leverage non-copy moves for real adoption already live below: **unplugin-jz** and
**dogfood own libs** under "Reach — perception/proof". They outrank every copy change combined.)


- [x] **AoS→SoA layout transform / f64x2 deinterleave** — WON'T BUILD, measured net-negative
  (2026-06-14). The `aos` bench IS the workload, and both SIMD forms are *slower* than the
  current optimal scalar on wasm's 128-bit SIMD (hand-WAT, N=16384×64, arm64/V8):
  AoS deinterleave (3×`v128.load` + 3×`i8x16.shuffle` per 2 rows) = **0.78×**; SoA contiguous
  (no shuffle, the layout-transform best case) = **0.92×**. The kernel is memory-bandwidth-bound
  — 2-wide SIMD moves the same bytes, so halving the instruction count doesn't help and the
  deinterleave shuffles only add cost. V8 lowers wasm `v128` to 128-bit SSE/NEON (2 f64 lanes),
  never 256-bit AVX2, so native's AVX2 4-lane deinterleave is structurally unreachable in
  portable wasm. jz scalar already beats Rust on `aos` on arm64 (0.97 vs 1.23 ms); the x86-EPYC
  gap is the AVX2 width ceiling, not a missing pass. The `simd-aos-stride` advisory stays as the
  only "answer"; don't build the transform.
- [x] Find all unlucky deopt cases and compare perf against JS: should not be 18x slower
  — Probed every generic-dispatch shape vs V8 (`.work/deopt-probe.mjs`). Ranked: **for-in
  was the cliff** (8–9×, scaling with key count = the "18×" class) — it lowered to a
  per-iteration `Object.keys` ALLOCATION + dynamic `o[k]` get, and leaked unboundedly
  (OOM). Now: (1) for-in over a static schema **unrolls** with key-literal substitution so
  `o[k]` folds to a schema slot (`unrollForIn`, recognized via the for-in-exclusive
  `__keys_ro` intrinsic, `src/compile/emit.js`) → **0.40× (2.5× faster than V8)**; (2) when
  it can't unroll (break/continue, closure capturing key, computed-write object) the key
  array is a **pooled static constant** (`__keys_ro`, `module/object.js`) — never a
  per-iteration alloc. Gated on a new precise `dynWriteVars` fact (computed-key WRITES add
  enumerable keys; reads/dot-adds don't — `program-facts.js`). Remaining dynamic shapes:
  `obj[k]` read 1.7× / write 1.9× (genuine dynamic keys — use a Map), plain-`[]` index 3.4×
  (use a typed array). Detector: `test/forin-deopt.js` (differential sweep + codegen pins +
  alloc-free behavioral pin). Also fixed a real bug: `memory.reset()` clobbered module-global
  heap objects (rewound below them) — now rewinds to the post-init mark (`interop.js`).
- [x] Verbose flag? Or at least - deopt warnings
  — Emit-site `deopt-*` advisories (truthful: fire only when a slow path is actually
  emitted, so an unrolled for-in / vectorized loop never false-warns). `warnDeopt`
  (`src/ctx.js`) with source loc + fn name: `deopt-dyn-read` (`o[k]`→`__dyn_get`),
  `deopt-dyn-write` (`o[k]=v`→`__dyn_set`), `deopt-method` (unknown receiver→`__ext_call`
  host round-trip). Joins the existing `deopt-generic`. Tests in `test/warnings.js`.
- [x] bench: remove interpreters; replace -> with arrow unicode; add 4 more MOST STANDARD bench cases across langs: fft, zzfx (some minisynth - audio pipeline), stdlib.io something, standard not-small bytebeat, some image pipeline, some codec maybe like wav or aiff?; hide watr, jessie, jz cases; beat everyone by speed and size, esp audio
  — Removed CPython/QuickJS/Hermes/Javy (bench.mjs + index.html + README + bench.yml); kept NumPy + Static Hermes as native refs. `JS -> WASM` → `JS → WASM`. Hid watr/jessie/jz from page + SVG geomean (`HIDDEN_FROM_GEOMEAN`; still runnable + gated). Added 4 cross-language bit-exact cases (js/c/rs/zig/go/as each): **fft** (radix-2, transcendental-free Taylor twiddles — jz ties native, 1.26× V8), **synth** (poly-osc+ADSR+biquad — jz FASTEST of all incl native, 1.42× V8), **bytebeat** (integer 8-bit PCM — jz 1.48× V8), **blur** (RGBA box blur — jz 2.78× V8). zzfx-as-is can't be cross-lang bit-exact (Math.sin differs per libm) → in-source poly minisynth substitutes. SVG geomean: jz beats every engine incl native (Rust 1.13× Zig 1.29× Go 1.79× Bun 1.70× V8 2.42× AS 2.34×). Fixed a real jz vectorizer bug en-route: sibling loops lifting the same source local emitted duplicate `$name__v` decls → "Duplicate local" crash on fft (`src/optimize/vectorize.js`, dedupe at splice; regression-pinned in `test/simd.js`). Codec deferred (4 cases delivered). Native auto-vectorizes the two stateless integer kernels (bytebeat/blur) — honest floor; jz still doubles the JS field there.
- [x] performance svg image should not confuse: we need a line that it's geomean from N examples or something. JZ should have underline O3, not -> wasm.
  — footer caption "geometric mean across N benchmark cases · lower is faster, jz = 1.00× baseline"; N drives BOTH the caption and the Porffor "runs k / N" denominator so they can't disagree (live run: `geoCases.length`; offline snapshot: `SNAPSHOT_N`). jz sub-label `→ wasm` → `-O3` (parallel to clang/rustc/asc -O3 — jz compiles at its L3 `level:'speed'` tier). CI already regenerates bench.svg on push-to-main (`bench.yml` full `--json` run → `git add bench/bench.svg`). `scripts/bench-svg.mjs` + `bench/bench.mjs` SVG_TARGETS; pinned by `test/bench-svg.js`.

### Module-level numeric tables drop the string runtime (2026-06-16)

The synth bench was 4.2× larger than AssemblyScript (7.7 KB vs 1.8 KB) — the worst size gap
in the corpus, and the audio flagship. Root cause: a module-level numeric `const` table
(`const FREQS = […]`, `const CHORDS = [[…],…]`) had untyped ("any") element reads, so
`T[i] * x` emitted the generic `__to_num`, dragging the full ~5 KB string-parse battery
(`__to_str`/`__skipws`/`__char_at`/`__pow10`/…) into a string-free kernel. Element typing
existed for function-local arrays; module globals were invisible to the using function's walk.

* [x] **Flat `const T = [n, …]`** (`45396e7`) — `recordGlobalRep` records `arrayElemValType`
  on the global rep; `VT['[]']` reads it (dynWriteVars-guarded). synth **7.7 KB → 2.0 KB**
  (3.85×); render 1260 → 373 WAT lines; the string stdlib drops out entirely.
* [x] **Nested `const C = [[n, …], …]`** (`c899064`) — the floatbeat chord/pattern-table
  shape, one level down: `arrayElemElemValType` rep field + recording; `C[i][j]` and
  `ch = C[i]; ch[j]` read sites typed; `program-facts` flags the ROOT var on a nested write
  `C[i][j]=…` (receiver-chain walk) for soundness. Nested tables **6 KB → 0.6 KB** (10.6×).
  Single-level (mirrors the local `arrElemElemValTypes` convention); deeper nesting falls
  back. Pinned in `test/minimal-output.js` (no-string + value + soundness; the flat fix was
  previously untested). Full matrix opt0/2/3 green (2329/0); null-write→0 confirms ToNumber
  routing, not the NaN-box coincidence.
* DON'T chase yet (no workload): a module **object** with an array field (`const O =
  { freqs: […] }; O.freqs[i]`) still pulls the string runtime — different mechanism
  (schema-slot → array-elem); no current example/bench uses the shape.

### Deferred-backlog drain — extending-add · scalar-cap 64 · interop hygiene (2026-06-16)

Three "deferred-on-no-workload" items had already shipped (or gone moot) without the live
backlog being ticked. Verified against code + git + suite, moved here.

* [x] **extending-add i8/i16→i32** (`f5213cb`) — `s += u8[i]` / `s += u16[i]` into an i32
  accumulator lifts via the `extadd_pairwise` chain to i32x4 partials (`WIDEN_LOADS`,
  `src/optimize/vectorize.js`); widening min/max over a bare narrow load also lands
  (`MINMAX_WIDEN`). Value-exact mod 2³² (pairwise intermediates can't overflow; restricted to
  a BARE load — lane arithmetic before widening would wrap at lane width). 5 pins in
  `test/simd.js` (u8/s8/u16/s16 sums + the "must NOT widen on lane arithmetic" boundary);
  simd suite 110/110.
* [x] **scalarization cap 32→64** (`087dc56`) — `maxScalarTypedArrayLen` defaults to 64
  (`src/compile/plan/common.js`), covering 8×8 block kernels (DCT/JPEG). The feared 128-local
  LEB128 cliff doesn't materialize: at 64 elements the scalarized form is ~2.2× smaller and
  2.5× faster than the memory form.
* [x] **Dead-code / interop hygiene tail** — all resolved: `objectLiteralEntries` is a live
  import used by `lowerObjectLiteralThis` (jzify/classes.js:159, wired via jzify/index.js +
  transform.js) — no shadow, no dead import; `opts.extMap` is no longer written anywhere;
  `cli.js` `profileNames` is gone; `opts.modules`/`noTailCall`/`nativeTimers` are documented
  (index.js:242-247).

### CI perf-gate robustification + exp2 fast-path (2026-06-10)

The "Celesta Dreams 1.43× / perf-fuzz failing" CI report was no regression — jz wins the
floatbeat corpus (geomean 0.52×) and perf-fuzz (geomeans 0.75–0.90× vs floors). The lone
failure was always Celesta tripping the floatbeat per-beat backstop (host-bound ratio: 0.78×
locally, 1.43× on the shared runner, *identical* wasm); perf-fuzz passed every run.

* [x] **exp2 single-build 2^k for the normal range** (`bff62ce`) — for k ∈ [−1022,1023] a
  single IEEE-exponent build is bit-identical to the two-factor split (powers of two multiply
  exactly) but ~5 ops cheaper; the split stays for denormal/overflow edges. Math.exp 1.41→1.31×
  vs V8, accuracy unchanged (maxRel 2.4e-9). Examples using exp rebuilt. Follow-on to PS-2.
* [x] **CI-aware floatbeat backstop** (`e31db26`) — geomean ≤1.0× stays the per-corpus guarantee
  everywhere; the per-beat backstop is a gross-regression net, loose (2×) on CI (still catches an
  __ptr_offset-style 4× cliff), tight (1.4×) off-CI. Mirrors native-C "informational on CI".
* [x] **perf-fuzz int/mixed max as blow-up nets** (`024bbb8`) — 1.35/1.75 → 1.60/2.25; they sat a
  hair over the legit CI tier-gap outliers (1.24/1.68) so were tripwires. Geomean caps (the real
  guard) unchanged. The max nets a single-program miscompile the geomean can't (1 blown of 30).
* [x] **Examples drift gate excludes jukebox beats** (`41785a5`) — floatbeat compiled bytes aren't
  reproducible across Node/V8 versions (CI Node 22 vs local 25.x); covered by bytebeat correctness
  + the floatbeat perf gate instead. Beat structural non-determinism root unpinpointed (flagged).
* [x] **Earlier this cycle** — BigInt-safe nodeEqual + csePureExpr hoist key (`b64cb46`);
  csePureExpr DAG refcount guard (`63a5669`); aos __ptr_offset cliff fix via unboxed ptrKind
  (in `d382edd`); nested mixed-arity `=== undefined` fold (`1a239ce`); robustified bytebeat
  asserts (maxBadFrac tolerance, `0c3fcfd`); floatbeat perf gate added (`b8bbfb4`).

### Examples gallery + JS⇆jz toggle + warn channel (2026-05/06)

* [x] **Examples gallery** + the **JS⇆jz-WASM toggle + FPS/compute-ms HUD** on the demos (shared
  loader `examples/lib/jzdemo.js`); **zzfx**; rfft spectrogram (detailed entry below).
* [x] **Warn channel** — `ctx.warn` + `opts.warnings` sink + CLI print; advisories:
  `adviseHeapGrowth` (no-auto-reclaim leak), untagged-errors (`instanceof` on Error names),
  Set/Map slot-order iteration, jsstring-carrier-declined, SIMD loop bails. `test/warnings.js`.
  (Lint "skip — enforced by subset": no-var/eqeqeq/no-undef/no-with/no-eval rejected at the
  subset boundary; borrow only ESLint's "use Y instead" message style.)

### Milestone — declared-monotone lattice + streamlining (audit 2026-05-29)

Roots **B** (monotone lattice — all 3 clearStickyNull gone) and **E** (closed ValueRep typedef
+ REP_FIELDS + dev validator) CLOSED. 8-step plan done: correctness gates (test262 fail===0 +
xfail/xpass; determinism), divergence docs, ctx-invariant net + ownership table, DRY (hostImport,
isBoundName, makeVal/TypedTracker F1), emitMethodCall→table + sidecarOverride, full opt0/1/3/wasi
CI matrix, the lattice (narrowValResults hoist + soft-val + hardParamVal). OPT-2 `__phase`
side-channel → explicit arg. Fixed 2 miscompiles the gate caught (bare `return;`→undefined;
`cond?undefined:x`→undefined), the bitwise loop-bound hoist (→ vectorized, 1.14→1.00× vs V8),
watr honest `trail` pin, the `1.e3` subscript lexer (upstream), wasi Date-clock flake. Remaining
roots (A caching/two-walk, C collectDeclFacts, wasm resetParamWasmFacts) assessed — fixes would
add machinery / regress perf, left intentionally.

### Audit-2026-05-29 frontier — correctness leaks + perf + optimizer batch — CLOSED (2026-06-04)

Every compiler item from the "fix correctness leaks, then reach" audit shipped; what
remains under that header is ecosystem/reach (AudioWorklet REPL, dogfood biquad,
unplugin-jz), tracked in the execution plan, not as compiler work. Verified: full
opt{0..3} + wasi matrix, selfhost 11/11, `CI=1 test/bench.js` 70/70, fuzzer green.

* [x] **PARSE-2** — unparenthesized unary base of `**` (`-x**2`, `delete x**2`, …) is now
  a SyntaxError per ES2016 §13.6 (guard in the `'**'` handler). Negative-parse skip set
  audited (`scripts/neg-parse-audit.mjs`, 0 accepts-invalid-JS); `test/parser-bugs.js`.
  PARSE-2B added `delete` to the guard.
* [x] **INTEROP-C1** — `serialize(undefined)` returns `'undefined'` (was `null` →
  `Object.keys(undefined)` crash). `index.js:529`.
* [x] **FE-3** — `try` handler preps the handler once (was twice when no `finally`; prep
  has side effects). `prepare/index.js:1356`.
* [x] **FE-6** — `prepareModule` wraps prep in try/finally so the 4 caller-state vars
  always restore, even when an imported dep throws mid-prep. `prepare/index.js:2464`.
* [x] **FUZZ-1** — Float64Array / Int32Array generative fuzzer (`test/fuzz.js --typed-map`,
  `--typed-int`): const-bound internal typed-array kernels (so they actually vectorize)
  with `?:`, diffed element-wise vs JS across opt{0..3}. Earned its keep — caught three
  pre-existing silent opt2/opt3 miscompiles, all operand-drop-without-purity bugs:
  `(select x x cond)` (vacuum) and the algebraic `PEEPHOLE` folds (`x&0`, `x^x`, `x*0`,
  idempotent `x&x`, self-compares) dropped an operand holding a typed-array element's
  address `local.tee`, leaving the store stale. All now `isPure`-gated (`src/wat/optimize.js`);
  affects any computed element write, not just reductions.
* [x] **expm1 cancellation** — dedicated Maclaurin series for `|x|<0.5` (was `exp(x)-1`,
  up to ~11% error near 0); preserves sign of ±0. `module/math.js:494`.
* [x] **PS-2 — math.exp O(1) 2^k** — `exp`→`exp2`; `exp2` builds `2^k` from the IEEE
  exponent bits split into two halves (`k2` + `k−k2`), no O(k≤1023) loop; poly over
  [-0.5,0.5], ~6e-9 rel. `module/math.js:471-487`.
* [x] **Optimizer SIMD/fold batch** (optimizer passes, 2026-06-02): product
  reductions (`*=` i32/i64/f32/f64, `REDUCE_OPS`); conditional-lane vectorization
  (`cond?x:y` → `v128.bitselect` + `LANE_COMPARE`, mask hoisted first so COND's address
  tee runs before the branches); i32 sum reductions (`fusedRewrite` folds the f64→ToInt32
  round-trip to `i32.add/sub` — exact, then it vectorizes); integer comparison fold
  (`f64.cmp(convert,convert)` → `i32.cmp`, `aa5a195`); pooled-const `global.get` splat.
  Tail-call optimization confirmed **already shipped** (`tcoTailRewrite`, `src/ir.js`,
  wired in compile + emit) — the backlog's "not implemented" was stale.
* [x] **Dead-code + interop hygiene (partial)** — `invalidateLocalsCache` dead import
  dropped; `JZIFY_TRANSFORM_OPS` dead export removed; magic `0x4000/0x7` → `LAYOUT.SSO_BIT`;
  per-call `TextEncoder`/`Decoder` → singleton in the heap-string hot path (`interop.js:32`).
  (objectLiteralEntries shadow / opts.extMap vestigial write / cli.js profileNames / opts
  docs still open — kept in the live tail.)

The ranked-ROI optimizer backlog is now fully shipped too (see "Compiler-optimization
backlog — CLOSED" below); only deferred-on-no-workload items remain (extending-add,
AoS→SoA, scalarization-cap). Representation carriers, language coverage (Date/test262),
the metacircular parser extraction, and source maps stay under the execution plan.

### Compiler-optimization backlog — CLOSED (2026-06-02/03/04)

The ranked-ROI optimizer backlog is fully shipped; what's left is deferred-on-no-workload
(extending-add, AoS→SoA, scalarization-cap), not open work.
Re-verified 2026-06-04 across the full gate: opt{0,1,2,3} + wasi (2033 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail
each), selfhost 11/11, perf-ratchet +0, `CI=1 bench` 70/70, fuzz typed-int 5000×4 + typed-map
5000×4 + scalar 5000×4 (77 655 inputs) — zero divergence.

* [x] **#1b int min/max reductions** (`6308f26`) — `m = a[i]>m?a[i]:m` over Int32Array → a
  select-shaped reduction body; `matchIntMinMaxReduce` recognizer + select-based horizontal
  fold (`i32x4.max_s/min_s`; no scalar `i32.min`; identity INT_MIN/MAX); overshoot-safe SIMD
  bound for the `m=a[0]; i=1` seed. `src/optimize/vectorize.js`.
* [x] **#1c int conditional vectorization** (`c5b30a5`) — `fusedRewrite` pushes ToInt32 through
  the universal-f64 `?:`: `ToInt32(if(result f64) C A B) → if(result i32) C toI32(A) toI32(B)`
  when both arms are integer-valued, + `ToInt32(int-valued f64) → i32` form + `i32.or X 0 → X`.
  `(cond?A:B)|0` over Int32Array then lifts via the i32 `LANE_COMPARE` + `v128.bitselect`.
  `src/optimize/index.js`, `src/optimize/vectorize.js`.
* [x] **#2 specializeMkptr threshold** (`496a236`) — tuned 5→**4** (the *measured* break-even),
  honoring the de-opt-risk concern rather than the speculative 5→3.
* [x] **#4 induction-variable strength reduction** (`dbf1d9d`) — affine scalar loops; + `fe3aa12`
  (LICM must not hoist a self-referential induction tee out of its loop).
* [x] **#7 SIMD byte-scan / memchr** (`052a455`) — `i8x16.eq` + `i8x16.bitmask`, 16 bytes/step;
  vectorizes Uint8Array delimiter scans (the parser/tokenizer charCodeAt-scan shape).
* [x] **#3 single-use helper inlining** — `inlineOnce` (single-call funcs → lone caller) +
  `propagate` (single-use locals / tiny consts) + `89fb454` copy-propagation + adjacent
  dead-store elimination (size). `src/wat/optimize.js`.
* [x] **Cheap generalizations** — cross-`if` CSE (`csePureExprLoop`); LICM global-read hoist
  (`hoistInvariantLoop` `pureGiven` admits invariant `global.get` + `SAFE_OFFSET_CALLS`;
  `promoteGlobals`). `src/optimize/index.js`.

(The earlier wave — product reductions, conditional-lane vectorization, i32 sum reductions,
integer comparison fold, pooled-const splat, tail-call — is in the frontier entry above.)

### Auto i32-index narrowing — the hoist idiom becomes a compiler pass (2026-05-22)

Supersedes "RFFT i32-hoist" below. The prior push made jz beat V8 by hand-hoisting
`let n = N | 0` into each kernel — a leaky abstraction (forces users to rewrite
idiomatic code for speed). Generalized it into the analyzer so **unmodified** source
gets the same i32 indexing.

* [x] **`collectI32SafeIndexVars` (src/analyze.js).** In `analyzeBody`'s widen pass, a
  counter compared against an f64 bound normally widens to f64 (overflow safety). Now
  exempted when it's an **affine component of a fully-i32 array index**: a valid wasm32
  byte-offset must fit i32 and an affine index is monotone in the counter, so the counter
  is provably i32-range — the exact guarantee the manual `|0` asserted. Kept i32 → direct
  indexing, no per-access `trunc_sat`; the compare coerces the counter instead. Transitive
  **back-propagation** over affine assignment/step edges (`let i0 = ix`, `i0 += id`) carries
  the proof through nested-loop index seeding (FFT butterflies). The assignment-widening
  fixpoint still runs after, so a genuinely fractional counter (`i = i/3`) overrides back to f64.
* [x] **Gated on a *fully-i32* index — the game-of-life regression is designed out.** Seeding
  fires only when `exprType(idx) === 'i32'`. An f64-strided index (`mem[y*w + x]`, f64 `w`)
  truncs regardless, so narrowing its counter would add a compare-convert for zero trunc
  savings — exactly the loss the old archive predicted for a blanket pass. Result:
  game-of-life / mandelbrot / interference wasm **byte-identical** before/after; only
  fully-i32-indexed kernels (rfft) change. This is *narrower* than "narrow mutable globals":
  it narrows **index counters**, never the globals, and only where it provably pays.
* [x] **rfft.js de-hoisted → idiomatic.** Removed `let n = N|0` / `hf = half|0` from
  transform/rfft/cepstrum; uses `N`/`half` directly. Output **bit-identical** to the hoisted
  wasm (0.0 diff). Module `trunc_sat` 86 → 18, wasm 10154 → 9902 B. Beats V8 **1.46×** on
  rfft() / **1.05×** on rfft()+cepstrum() (`examples/rfft/bench.mjs`, best-of-8, N=2048).
* [x] **Tests + verify.** 3 regression tests in test/perf.js (i32 index stays i32; transitive
  nest narrows; f64-strided index does NOT narrow). Full suite 1854 pass / 0 fail / 1 skip.
* [x] **Residual headroom → closed by integer-global inference (2026-05-22).** The loop guard
  `i < N` used to convert the i32 counter to f64 each iteration (f64 bound). New pass
  `inferModuleIntGlobals` (src/plan.js) narrows numeric module globals to **i32 by default**,
  demoting to f64 only on *proof* of a fraction (non-integer literal, `/`, `**`, float `Math.*`,
  or a reference to an already-fractional value; fixpoint propagates fractionality through
  cross-global refs). A numeric-init global later assigned a non-number (string/object/array)
  is disqualified → stays the f64 box (write-path coercion fixed in `writeVar`/emitDecl). With
  `N` an i32 global the guard is pure-i32 and `mem[y*width+x]` (i32 `width`) is a fully-i32
  address. Now **no manual `|0` needed** — idiomatic rfft.js beats V8 **1.69–1.74×** rfft() /
  **1.14–1.16×** +cepstrum() (was 1.46× / 1.05×). game-of-life neutral (branch/call-bound, 0.82×

### RFFT i32-hoist beats V8 · cepstrogram demo · linefont FPS sparkline (2026-05-22)

The "beat V8 on RFFT / integer-index by any means" push, plus the demo features it powers.

* [x] **i32-hoist idiom — jz beats V8 1.70× on the FFT kernel.** Root cause of the prior
  *JS 1.5× ahead* on RFFT: jz's universal-f64 number model boxes loop-bound **globals** as
  f64 (compile.js only narrows `const` globals with constant-int initializers), so every
  `x[i]` emitted an `i32.trunc_sat_f64_s` and the loop counters ran in f64. Fix is one line
  per kernel — hoist the f64 globals into i32 locals at the top of the hot function
  (`let n = N | 0;`): the narrower types **locals** off the `|0` i32 signal and cascades i32
  through every derived index (`i0`, `i1`, …). WAT trunc_sat count **76 → 13**; all index
  locals i32; loop arithmetic native i32. Measured (`.work/rfft-bench.mjs`, paired
  same-source jz-wasm vs JS-ESM, best-of-8): **rfft() jz 1.63–1.70× over V8** across
  N=512–8192 (1.70× at 2048: jz 7.7 vs JS 13.0 µs); **rfft()+cepstrum() jz 1.45–1.52×**;
  correctness max|Δ| ~1e-11; wasm 9909 B (smaller than before). `examples/rfft/rfft.js`.
* [x] **Idiom is opt-in, NOT a blanket compiler pass — game-of-life regressed.** Applying the
  same hoist to game-of-life's step/rot (`let w=width|0,h=height|0,off=offset|0`) made it
  *slower* (0.74× → 0.67× vs JS). Root cause: game-of-life is **branch/call-bound** (per-cell
  ternaries, `rot()` call, Uint32Array values near 2³²), not index-bound — the hoist adds
  i32↔f64 traffic without removing a trunc-heavy inner loop. Reverted; production untouched
  (only `.work/gol-i32.js` probe was edited). This is the evidence that a global "narrow
  mutable f64 globals to i32" pass would do harm — keep it a documented **kernel idiom**.
  A mutable-global narrowing pass stays deferred (analyze.js 3818 LOC / 1851 tests, high risk,
  game-of-life counterexample).
* [x] **transform() refactor preserves the win.** Extracted the bit-reverse + butterfly core
  (shared by `rfft()` and `cepstrum()`) into a non-exported `transform()` carrying the i32
  hoist; both callers re-hoist `n`/`half` locally. Win held (7.74 µs / 1.68× at 2048).
* [x] **Real cepstrum.** `cepstrum()` = IDFT of the log-magnitude spectrum. Log-mag is real &
  even-symmetric → its DFT is real, so it reuses the same forward `transform()` and keeps the
  real part / N. A peak at quefrency q ⇒ period q samples ⇒ pitch ≈ sampleRate/q; the
  cepstrogram traces the melody. Verified: 220 Hz tone → cepstral peak at quefrency 199
  (expected 200.5), JS/jz agree 6.9e-11. `examples/rfft/rfft.js`.
* [x] **Demo (`examples/rfft/index.html`) — all requested features, browser-verified.**
  Scrolling **cepstrogram** (ABGR palette LUT, log-quefrency rows) with the **momentary
  waveform overlaid** (transparent oscilloscope canvas), **wavefont** peak-hold spectrum bars,
  **click-to-shuffle** (picks a different floatbeat tune of 5, rebuilds the looped audio
  buffer), and a **live code panel** showing the playing tune's source. Audio gated behind a
  one-gesture `#play`. Verified: cepstrogram lit (maxlum 715), waveform overlay 4231 px,
  bars 94/110 active, both fonts loaded, jz compute 0.06 ms/frame @ 121 fps, shuffle
  arp→chord pad, 0 console errors.
* [x] **linefont FPS sparkline in the shared HUD (`examples/lib/jzdemo.js`).** The FPS line is
  now a **linefont** sparkline — each recent fps sample is the glyph at `0x100+value`, and the
  font's ligatures join them into one continuous line chart. Plotted on an **absolute** scale
  (full height = `ref`, which rises to the display refresh rate) so the line sits at the true
  level and **steps when the engine is swapped**. Fixed two scaling flaws found in the browser:
  (1) a decaying-peak relative scale read a steady 23 fps as flat-100 (hid the level and the
  engine gap) → switched to absolute; (2) `ref` latched onto a transient — the first frame
  seeded `fps = 1000/dt ≈ 950`, bumping `ref` permanently so steady 121 fps read 13/100 →
  clamp sub-4ms frames (`Math.min(1000/dt, 240)`) and warm the EMA up from 0 so `ref` settles
  on the real refresh. Verified: mandelbrot (23 fps) reads ~19/100, RFFT (121 fps) reads
  ~97/100, JS⇄jz toggle steps the line. Fonts `examples/lib/{linefont,wavefont}.woff2`.

Demos verified live via Playwright; `.work/rfft-bench.mjs` is the reproducible perf harness.

### `x ** 0.5` → `f64.sqrt` fold · startup/REPL bench · numeric monomorphization wontfix (2026-05-22)

Mined two archived JS→WASM compilers (TurboScript, speedy.js) for borrowable design;
three candidates, each judged against jz's *actual* corpus, not on paper.

* [x] **`x ** 0.5` → `f64.sqrt` fold.** The startup bench flagged the headline `dist`
  example (`(x*x+y*y) ** 0.5`) compiling to 1058 B / 3.9 ms — it emitted the full
  `$math.pow` exp/log polyfill. Folded `** 0.5` (and `Math.pow(x, 0.5)`, same handler)
  to `f64.sqrt` in `module/math.js`, beside the existing integer-exponent square-and-
  multiply fold. `dist`: **1058 B → 67 B**, compile **3.9 → 0.41 ms**, warm **0.4× →
  2.3×** vs V8 — size, cold, and warm all at once. Correctness: f64.sqrt is correctly
  rounded, so bit-identical to `Math.pow(x, 0.5)` on every normal input and to jz's own
  `Math.sqrt(x)` by construction (always `canon`, since a negative finite base yields a
  NaN whose sign needs canonicalizing — mirrors the `math.sqrt` emit). Two exotic inputs
  follow sqrt over Math.pow, deliberate trades in the same class as jz's other boundary
  divergences: `(-0) ** 0.5` = -0 (Math.pow: +0; -0 === 0), `(-Infinity) ** 0.5` = NaN
  (Math.pow: +Infinity). `** -0.5` intentionally **not** folded — `1/sqrt` double-rounds
  and loses the last ULP vs Math.pow's single rounding; keeps the exact `$math.pow` path.
  Differential-tested across 19 edge inputs before committing. `module/math.js`.
* [x] **Cold/warm + instantiation benchmark** (speedy.js VMIL'17 methodology). Built
  `scripts/bench-startup.mjs` (`npm run bench:startup`): per-snippet src→wasm, wasm→
  instance, jz cold, `new Function`→first result, warm per-call, bytes — snippets are
  pure scalar kernels, valid jz *and* valid standalone JS. Finding: **jz cold-start is
  200–1400× slower than `new Function` + first call** — jz does real AOT work (infer/
  narrow/vectorize/encode) the JS engine skips via lazy compile. The commented-out README
  "compiles faster than `eval`" line is **false**; kept out. jz's edge is tiny portable
  wasm + warm numeric speed on real kernels, not REPL latency.
* [x] **Function-level monomorphization (TurboScript generics) — wontfix.** Idea: clone
  a non-exported function per call-site numeric signature when sites disagree (one i32,
  one f64) instead of leaving the param boxed f64. Probed the trigger across the corpus:
  **bench 0 hits; full suite (~1850 programs) 2 hits**, both a trivial synthetic
  `add(a,b)`. Root cause it can't pay off: `inlineHotInternalCalls` (plan.js:2100) runs
  *before* `narrowSignatures` (plan.js:2127) — hot polymorphic helpers are inlined into
  each site and type-specialized there, strictly better than cloning (no call, no extra
  function). Cloning would only help a function both too big to inline *and* called at
  mixed numeric types — doesn't occur. TurboScript needed it for explicit `Foo<T>`
  generics; jz has none. ~80 speculative lines, zero corpus win. Probe is easy to
  reconstruct; re-open only if a real workload surfaces the pattern.

Follow-ups carried forward as live tasks: Math.* stdlib-pull audit (Perf §, sister to the
sqrt fold), README FAQ entry for the `** 0.5` corners (Ship §), parallelism substrate
(Future § threads/atomics, scope filled in).

Suites: unit 1851 pass / 0 fail; bench gate 81 pass / 0 fail.

### Lint-inspired structural passes — i32 / switch / dupe-keys / form folds (2026-05-21)

The "fix structurally where jz invented the gap" half of the lint-inspired plan. Two
were verified-held (pinned, no code change); two were real lowering/codegen work.

* [x] **i32 narrow range-safety (`no-loss-of-precision`)** — *verified held*. The narrower
  picks i32 only on an i32 *signal* (i32-literal init + i32-only operands / `x|0` / bitwise /
  Int32Array read); any non-i32 source (f64 param, division, elems > 2^31) stays NaN-boxed
  f64 with the exact value. An all-i32-signal accumulator wrapping mod 2^32 is the deliberate
  value-model trade (powers `i32x4` SIMD reductions + scalar digit parsers), not an ambiguity
  bug — a "widen self-accumulators" pass was prototyped and rejected (broke those tests).
  Pinned both directions in `test/inference.js` ("i32 range-safety: …"). `src/analyze.js`.
* [x] **switch fall-through / `default` (`no-fallthrough`)** — lowering rewritten. The old
  if/else-if chain ran one body only; it couldn't express fall-through, stacked labels,
  mid-list `default`, or string discriminants (string switch returned `[0,0,0]` — the
  synthetic temp shed its STRING type and strict-`===` folded every case to `false`). New
  `transformSwitch` is two-phase, evaluated once with no goto: (1) entry index via `===`
  chain over labels (first match, else `default`'s index, else past-end); (2) run clauses
  where `entry <= i`, a `break` flipping a sticky `brk` flag (`rewriteSwitchBreaks`). A
  bare-identifier discriminant uses no temp (keeps its type); `stripTerminalSwitchBreak`
  → `normalizeCaseBody` (keeps breaks for the flag to gate). `src/jzify.js`; 4 capability
  pins in `test/types.js` (fall-through, stacked, default-mid, string). Parser caveat: a
  statement on the *same line* after a `switch {…}` still fails to parse (subscript jessie
  omits the block-boundary signal — `feature/switch.js` `switchBody` skips `}` without
  `parse.exit`); newline-separated (normal style) parses fine. Upstream-gated.
* [x] **duplicate object keys (`no-dupe-keys`)** — *verified held*. Last-wins → single slot
  (`{a:1,a:2}.a===2`, `Object.keys` dedups). Pinned in `test/objects.js`.
* [x] **form normalizations → IR fold (no warning).** `Math.pow(x,n)` constant integer
  exponent (`|n| ≤ 8`) → inline square-and-multiply, eliding the math.pow/exp/log stdlib
  (`module/math.js`, `test/math.js`). `~~x` → single `toI32` (the two xor-with-(-1) cancel;
  NaN/Infinity guard lives in `toI32`, runs once — value-identical to the old double-`~`,
  0 xors vs 2; `src/emit.js` `~`). `!!e` in pure boolean position (if/while/for-cond/`?:`,
  *not* value-preserving `&&`/`||`) → `e`, dropping the double-`eqz` (`src/prepare.js`
  `stripBoolNot`). Both pinned in `test/types.js` with IR-count assertions. Remnants
  (parseInt-of-literal, self-assign, useless-concat/return) left active — low value.

Suites: unit 1851 pass / 0 fail / 1 skip.

### Strict `===` + arg-position ToString (2026-05-21)

Follow-on to the boolean carrier: closed the equality and ToString gaps it
exposed.

* [x] **Un-conflate `===`/`!==` from loose `==`/`!=`.** Strict for
  statically-typed operands — a proven type mismatch folds to `false`/`true`
  with **no coercion** (`true === 1` is `false`, `"1" === 1` is `false`),
  unlike `==`. Same-type operands behave as before. `prepStrictEq` +
  `emitStrictEq`/`STRICT_PRIM` (src/prepare.js, src/emit.js); jzify keeps the
  loose/strict distinction (src/jzify.js). Untyped-dynamic operands stay a
  documented gap (the `null === undefined` unification too).
* [x] **Root-cause fixes surfaced by the above.** (1) `OP_MODULES` now maps
  `===`/`!==` → `['core','string']` (src/autoload.js) so the string module
  registers `__str_eq` when only strict ops appear — was
  `internal: stdlib '__str_eq' was requested but never registered`. (2)
  Destructuring registers each binding name in the arrow's local scope
  (src/prepare.js `prepDecl`), and a bare-identifier source destructures
  without a copy temp — so `let [,x]=strs; typeof x` resolves `'string'`
  instead of mis-folding to `'undefined'` (it was invisible to
  `isUnresolvableBareIdent`). Pinned by 2 new `test/destruct.js` tests.
* [x] **Boolean→ToString in argument position.** `parseInt`/`parseFloat`
  render a statically-known boolean as `"true"/"false"` before parsing
  (`strInputI64`, module/number.js); `String.indexOf`/`includes` coerce a
  BOOL needle the same way and an OBJECT needle via compile-time
  ToPrimitive(string) (`searchArg`, module/string.js). All reuse the existing
  `emitBoolStr`.
* [x] **test262 builtins 719 → 721** — `parseInt(boolean)` /
  `parseFloat(boolean)` unskipped (were fed the 0/1 carrier). Baseline bumped
  in `.github/workflows/test262.yml`. `indexOf/searchstring-tostring.js` stays
  xfail for one reason only: `String({})` is JSON-ish `"{}"`, not
  `"[object Object]"` — all other needle types (bool/number/null/undefined/
  array) now pass.

Suites: unit 1830 pass / 0 fail / 1 skip; test262 language 1431 / 0; builtins
721 / 0. README boolean/FAQ prose untouched (no new divergence — these are
correctness fixes).

### Real-boolean carrier (2026-05-21)

`true`/`false` carry as the cheap `0`/`1` i32 internally — branches and arithmetic
pay nothing, exactly as before. A real boolean is materialized **lazily, only where
boolean-ness is observed**: `typeof`, `String`, `JSON.stringify`, and the host
boundary. The carrier is the existing NaN-box ATOM family (`FALSE_NAN` aux=4 /
`TRUE_NAN` aux=5, siblings of `NULL_NAN`/`UNDEF_NAN`); `4 | truthbit` boxes, decoded
at the boundary like `null`/strings. No `memory.Boolean` wrapper, no wasm-gc — the
atom tags discriminate in wasm-v1 (wasm-gc's `i31ref(0)` wouldn't anyway).

* [x] **Lazy boxing at the export boundary** (`src/compile.js:608`
  `boolBoxIR(typed(callIR, …))`, `isBoundaryWrapped` ← `func.valResult === VAL.BOOL`).
  The inner `$f` keeps the `f64.convert_i32_s` 0/1 carrier; only the `$f$exp` thunk
  reboxes (`__mkptr(0, 4 | __is_truthy(…), 0)`) and is marked `"r":1` in `jz:i64exp`.
  Number-returning exports emit no i64exp entry — zero footprint off the boolean path.
* [x] **`decode` learns the two atoms** (`interop.js:146-155`) — `0x7FF80004 → false`,
  `0x7FF80005 → true`, beside the existing null/undefined arms. Module-private; the
  host export wrapper applies it. Host→jz booleans still coerce to 0/1 via `wrapVal`.
* [x] **Observation sites classify BOOL** (`src/analyze.js` `valTypeOf`): `!`, all
  relational/equality operators, `in`, `instanceof`, `Boolean()` → `VAL.BOOL`;
  `narrowBoolResults()` infers `valResult` on the narrowing-skip leaf path
  (`plan.js` `canSkipWholeProgramNarrowing`). `typeof`/`String`/`JSON.stringify`
  already observe the atom (truthy chain + `isBoolAtom`, `src/ir.js`).
* [x] **IR** (`src/ir.js`) — `BOOL_ATOM_BASE=4`, `FALSE_NAN`/`TRUE_NAN`, `boolBoxIR`
  (materialize from 0/1, used only at the boundary), `unboxBoolIR`, `isBoolAtom`.
* [x] **Tests — `test/booleans.js` (15 tests / 40 assertions)** pin: boundary decode
  for comparisons/equality/`!`/`Boolean()`/literals; `typeof`/`String`/`JSON.stringify`
  observation; branch & arithmetic positions stay the cheap carrier (codegen pin via
  `jz:i64exp` absence); host→jz 0/1 coercion; and the two honest gaps —
  value-preserving `&&`/`||` and bare container reads cross as 1/0. Carrier-only flips
  (1→true, 0→false; value never changed) propagated across errors/statements/strings/
  unsigned/types/symbols/destruct/features/number-methods.
* [x] **README** — "Booleans carry as numbers, surface as booleans" rewritten from
  the old "planned" note to the shipped behaviour, with the two documented limits.

Supersedes the former Deferred › "Boolean ATOM tag" entry. Suite: 1813 → 1828 pass.


#### Product / measurement (needs a measurement+product session, not a compiler edit)
* [x] **AS ecosystem audit.** Done → [.work/ecosystem-audit.md](ecosystem-audit.md).
  Verdict: **don't port AS's test suite** (it asserts a different language;
  test262 + differential fuzzer + bench gate are the right targets). DO mine AS's
  showcase compute kernels (path tracer, emulator core, codec, hash) into
  `bench/`/`examples/`. AS's real traction is blockchain — out of jz's scope,
  don't follow. Sequenced reach plan below.


### Representation carriers — foundation + done workstreams (2026-05-19/20)

Per-site carrier inference. Design narrative (user surface, evidence ladder,
what-ships-vs-what-drops, open policy questions) moved to `.work/research.md` ›
"Representation -> per-site, inferred". Open carriers stay live under `#### Representation`.

* [x] **Narrowing investigation (primary).** Survey (`.work/narrow-survey.mjs`,
  `narrow-watr-hotspots.mjs`; findings `.work/narrow-findings.md`): every numeric /
  typed-array bench already at zero fallbacks; only watr (self-hosted WAT compiler) has
  any — 1289 emits, 47.5 % in its top 10 funcs. Conclusion: remaining dynamic-shape wins
  are codegen-layout + SSO-peephole, not narrower gaps. Follow-ups: C.1 (`Array.isArray`
  facts through `?:`/`&&`/`||`) + F.1 (`for-in` known-schema unroll) landed; C.2
  (`x==null` flow-narrowing) deferred — no nullable-rep consumer.
* [x] **Per-site flat-number specialization.** Verified done-in-effect 2026-05-19: zero
  `*.reinterpret_*` / `__num_box` / `__num_unbox` across 5 bench kernels (crc32, mat4,
  bitwise, sort, biquad). Achieved by narrowing (`narrow.js` phases D param-spec, E
  i32-results, E3 pointer-results, G TYPED ABI) + `analyze.js` `exprType` i32 propagation.
  The `flatI32`/`flatF64` carrier-bundle refactor judged architectural sugar (no
  behavioral benefit) — not built; named goal already reached.
* [x] **SSO flow-through.** Landed 2026-05-19: (a) compile-time literal+literal concat
  folds to one literal (`prepare.js` `'+'`); (b) runtime `__str_concat{,_raw}` SSO-repack
  fast path when both operands SSO and total ≤ 4 (`module/string.js`). Probe confirms heap
  stays pinned for repeated small concats; heap path still fires for total > 4.
* [x] **Foundation (do not undo).** One-file-per-type `src/abi/` (`string.js` sso default +
  jsstring scaffold; `number.js` nanboxF64); slot-carrier contract (carriers emit inline,
  no `src/*` imports); `ctx.abi.<type>.ops.<op>` per-site dispatch; carrier peephole
  (`nanboxF64.peephole`); single `interop.js` codec (DRIVERS table removed).

(jsstring boundary carrier and `opts.host` user surface have their own dated entries below.)

### opts.host user surface + custom sections reference + SoA boundary pin (2026-05-20)

Cleanup pass on the `opts.host` knob and a pinned boundary for SIMD
vectorization. No new feature surface — the work made existing behaviour
visible and irreversible.

* [x] **`host: 'gc'` reserved-mode error** (`index.js:315`). Distinct error
  text so users see it as planned-future, not unknown-garbage: "reserved for
  a planned wasm-gc backend, not yet implemented. Use 'js' (default …) or
  'wasi' (standalone runtimes — no env imports)."
* [x] **wasi tolerance comment** (`src/emit.js:2563`). Documents that the
  silent `undefExpr()` fallthrough for unknown receivers under `host: 'wasi'`
  is by-design — `test/wasi.js` cases 235 and 245 pin it explicitly so
  polymorphic source can target both modes from one source. `strict: true`
  is the documented fail-fast opt-in.
* [x] **README — host modes**. Existing `host: 'js'` / `'wasi'` FAQ extended
  with the `gc` reservation note and a pointer to `strict: true` for users
  who want the wasi unknown-receiver path to error instead of no-op.
* [x] **README — custom sections reference** (new FAQ). First public
  documentation of the four sections jz emits: `jz:schema` (rehydration
  shapes), `jz:rest` (rest-param fixed counts), `jz:i64exp` (per-export
  i64-ABI map for NaN-canonicalization dodging), `jz:extparam` (externref
  param positions + JS-side defaults — written by the jsstring carrier).
  Names declared stable; binary layouts declared internal.
* [x] **SoA vectorization — README FAQ + tests** (`test/simd.js`,
  `README.md`). Documents the supported shapes (same-array, cross-array,
  SoA-3 / SoA-4 separate typed arrays per field) and the unsupported AoS
  interleaved shape with the mechanical migration path. Three new tests:
  SoA-3 fused map lifts to `f64x2`; SoA-4 RGBA luminance blend lifts; AoS-
  stride-2 must NOT lift (parity intact) — pins the boundary so future
  changes can't accidentally promise AoS without a real struct-splitting
  carrier. Counterpoint to the still-open Live-work AoS-write bullet, which
  remains the multi-week deferred carrier.

**Skipped deliberately:** a `jz:host` feature-stamp custom section. `interop.js`
already detects required features from imports (`wasi_snapshot_preview1`,
`env`, `wasm:js-string`); the extra surface adds no consumer value and would
become permanent maintenance debt.

tests: 1769 → 1772 pass (+3); commit `06b0e69`.

### jsstring boundary carrier (2026-05-20)

The `jsstring` carrier from `src/abi/string.js` is now wired end-to-end as a
**per-export-param boundary opt-in**. Eligible exports take their string param
as `externref` (zero-copy JS-string pass-through) instead of the f64/SSO carrier
(per-call UTF-8 transcode into wasm memory).

* [x] **Narrower phase J — `applyJsstringBoundaryCarrier`** (`src/narrow.js`).
  Per export, per param, flip `p.type` from `f64` to `externref` *only if* every
  use is `wasm:js-string`-builtin-mappable AND at least one use proves the param
  is a string. Proof sources, any of: (a) a `.charCodeAt` use (string-only
  method), (b) call-site rep evidence `VAL.STRING`, (c) string-literal default
  `s = ''` (declared intent). Rejects: reassignment / `++` / `--`, closure
  capture, escape into non-builtin calls, unbounded `.charCodeAt` (would trap
  where JS returns `NaN`). Standalone entry point exported for
  `canSkipWholeProgramNarrowing` short-circuit. Gated by `jsstringEnabled()` —
  off under `host: 'wasi'`, off when `optimize.jsstring === false`.
  `scanBoundedLoops` exported from `src/analyze.js` for the in-bounds proof.
* [x] **Builtin import channel** (`ctx.core.jsstring: new Set()` in `src/ctx.js`).
  Drained at module-assembly into `(import "wasm:js-string" "<name>" …)` nodes
  with `JSS_IMPORT_SIGS` from `src/abi/string.js`. The set tracks only the
  builtin names actually used by this module.
* [x] **Lowering** — `module/core.js` `emitLengthAccess` dispatches on
  `va?.type === 'externref'` → `(call $__jss_length va)`; the call site reads
  `emit(obj)` *before* `asF64` so the externref type isn't stripped.
  `src/emit.js` in-bounds `.charCodeAt` dispatch checks `recv?.type === 'externref'`
  → `(call $__jss_charCodeAt recv idx)`.
* [x] **Boundary wrapper + custom section** (`src/compile.js`). Boundary wrapper
  takes `(param externref)` for flipped slots; the wrapping i64/f64 ABI dance
  is skipped on those slots. A `jz:extparam` JSON custom section records, per
  export name, the indices `p:[…]` whose carrier is externref, plus optional
  `d:{idx:'str'}` for JS-side defaults so the wasm side never sees a null
  externref. Default-param init loop in `emitFunc` skips the `=== undefined`
  branch for jsstring params (substitution moves to the JS-side wrapper).
* [x] **interop.js boundary wiring**. Reads `jz:extparam`; for marked indices
  the wrapper writes `(${a} === undefined ? ${dn} : ${a})` directly, skipping
  `mem.wrapVal` (which would NaN-box the JS string). Native `wasm:js-string`
  detected by a one-time probe: if `new WebAssembly.Module(buf, { builtins:
  ['js-string'] })` instantiates with no imports, the engine handles the
  builtins itself (V8 17+ / Node 25+ / Safari 18.4+); otherwise a JS polyfill
  (`(s) => s.length`, `(s, i) => s.charCodeAt(i)`) is attached.
* [x] **Opt-out flag** — `optimize.jsstring: false` ([src/optimize.js] PASS_NAMES
  + the `jsstringEnabled()` gate in narrow.js) keeps every param on the
  f64/SSO carrier. Used for paired benches and engines that mishandle the
  builtins option.
* [x] **Tests — 10 / 22 assertions** ([test/jsstring.js]). Covers: opt-in fires
  on bounded `.charCodeAt`+`.length`; runtime correctness sums char codes
  through externref; `.length`-only stays polymorphic (number → undefined);
  unbounded `.charCodeAt` declines (trap-safety); reassignment / closure
  capture / `s + 'x'` escape all decline; string-literal default fires the
  opt-in even without `.charCodeAt`; JS-side default substitution on
  `undefined`; numeric default doesn't trigger.
* [x] **Bench** — `bench/jsstring/bench-jsstring.mjs` paired-compilation
  baseline. On Node 25.9 native, `.length(s)` opt-in is 22× faster at 8 chars,
  154× at 256, 5510× at 8192 — boundary-copy elimination dominates. `.sum(s)`
  (`.charCodeAt` loop) is 10.5× / 1.5× / 1.3× faster across the same sizes —
  win compresses as per-char work begins to dominate. Jessie section
  documents the correct-rejection case (param escapes into `parse()` — not a
  builtin — both compilations byte-identical, ~1.0× ratio confirms no
  side-effect).
* [x] **README** — new FAQ "How do strings cross the boundary?" with the
  two-carrier table, opt-in trigger matrix, engine support, opt-out flag, and
  bench pointer.

### watr 4.6.9 upgrade — drop 'light' mode workaround (2026-05-20)

* [x] **'light' watr mode removed** (`a26ea84`). L2 was running a curated watr
  subset (`inline / inlineOnce / coalesce` all off) since 4.6.4 to dodge two
  upstream miscompiles:
  - **W1a** — `inlineOnce` dropped a single-call helper's bare-`local.get`
    body (root-node `walkPost` return value discarded; substitution lost).
  - **W1b** — `coalesceLocals` merged a zero-dependent local into a residue-
    carrying slot when `inlineOnce`'s `needsReset` zero-init ran before
    `propagate`'s cleanup sweep. Trigger: `/a.+b/.test("ab")`.

  watr 4.6.9 ships fixes for both. L2 now runs the full watr default pipeline
  (treeshake / dedupe / dedupTypes / coalesce / propagate / packData / fold /
  peephole / vacuum / mergeBlocks / brif / loopify / inlineOnce / …). `inline`
  stays off per watr's own default — opt-in only; can duplicate bodies. L3 no
  longer needs an "inlining bonus" — its preset reads truthfully as L2 + larger
  array/hash initial caps + `hoistConstantPool` off.

* [x] **jz csePureExpr snapId — high-water mark, not first gap** (`fed07f8`).
  watr's full `coalesceLocals` removes redundant locals, so the surviving
  `$__pe<N>` set is non-contiguous; the old first-gap allocator picked an
  already-live id and triggered "Duplicate local $__pe20" on mat4. Fixed by
  scanning all surviving cse-pure-expr locals for a high-water mark.

* [x] **17 codegen-shape tests rewired to `optimize: { watr: false }`**.
  Tests in `test/{types,closures,features,feature-gating,optimizer,inference}.js`
  verify jz's compile-time decisions (slot-type dispatch, narrowed return
  types, closure-unbox declarations, escape-analysis allocations, LICM snap
  locals, sourceInline skip-into-export, charCodeAt i32 propagation, …) — not
  watr's downstream cleanup. With full watr running at L2, `inlineOnce` would
  fold non-exported helpers into their lone caller and `treeshake` would erase
  them, so a `(func $mk …)` regex no longer matched. Probe call sites now opt
  out of watr explicitly, making the intent visible at each call.

* [x] **Subscript / watr dead-code workarounds dropped** (`8ef4b46`, `4f9e64a`):
  trailing-null pop in `'()'` emit (closed by subscript 10.4.13's S12 fix) and
  the W5 unsigned-hex `i64.const` dance (closed by watr 4.6.8 handling signed
  hex strings directly). Workaround tag in `prepare.js` 1768–1777 (S2 `new`
  precedence) and the IIFE/labeled-stmt patches in `jzify.js` remain — gated
  on the next subscript release.

bumps: `subscript 10.4.12 → 10.4.13`, `watr 4.6.8 → 4.6.9`.
tests: 1759/1759 unit; 81/81 bench-shape; bench parity holds.

### test262 language tail + native-gap audit (2026-05-19)

* [x] **5 language fails → 0** (language suite 1423→1429, baseline bumped).
  Three codegen defects + one harness boundary fix — `fix:` commit `117fbd0`:
  - comma Expression in a for-in/of head (`for (x in A, B)`) — `jzify.js`
    `normalizeForDeclHead` generalized + new `normalizeForCommaHead` fold the
    trailing operands back into the iterated source; internal crash eliminated.
  - `[,]` / `[1,,]` array elisions — `prepare.js` `'[]'` over-trimmed a trailing
    `null`; jessie already consumes the trailing comma, so every residual `null`
    is a genuine hole. Trim removed.
  - `dedupeRedecls` read only the first name of a multi-name bare `let`, leaking
    a redeclaration when a hoisted function `const` shared the name. Now walks
    every declarator.
  - `test262.js` ASSERT_HARNESS terminated with `;` — works around a subscript
    ASI bug (no semicolon after an arrow block body before `(`). Upstream
    subscript bug — repro belongs in plan Part 1.
* [x] **crc32 vs native** — wasm-v1 floor. jz 11.95 ms = 1.12× clang -O3, beats
  V8 (13.34 ms). Native's edge is the SSE4.2 `crc32` hardware instruction; SIMD
  folding needs carryless multiply (`clmul`, a separate wasm proposal). The CRC
  accumulator is strictly loop-carried — `vectorizeLaneLocal` correctly declines.
  No jz codegen change available; scalar table-driven is optimal.
* [x] **mandelbrot vs AS** — wasm-v1 algorithmic floor (no scalar `fma`),
  proposal-blocked. (`interference` / `game-of-life` are not in the bench suite.)
* [x] **f64 cross-array-map vectorization** — `optimize:` commit `b3bd828`.
  `vectorizeLaneLocal` now sees through the CSE'd offset-tee a map `b[i]=f(a[i])`
  over two base pointers produces (`(local.tee $T (i32.shl i K))` then
  `(local.get $T)`). New `matchLaneOffset` + `_offsetLocalStride` soundness gate
  in `src/vectorize.js`, wired into `tryVectorize` + `tryReduceVectorize`. f64
  cross-array map loops now emit `f64x2`; tests in `test/simd.js`. AoS-write and
  i32 mixed-width remain — see Live work › "native-gap audit".

### Generality track — Step 3 (2026-05-19)

* [x] **Slice views.** `__str_slice_view` / `SLICE_BIT` returns a no-copy view
  into the parent buffer when escape analysis proves the slice never outlives
  it; falls back to copy for SSO parents or oversized lengths.
* [x] **Literal interning.** `dataDedup` / `strPoolDedup` pool string-literal
  data segments — equal literals share one offset, compare by pointer.
* [x] **`s[i] === 'X'` no-alloc charcode compare** (`emitSingleCharIndexCmp`).
* [x] **`<str>.{substr,substring,slice}(…) === <other>` no-alloc** (`8b74dce`).
  `emitSubstringEqCmp` peepholes the call-↔-value pair to `__str_{substring,
  slice}_eq`, which clamp the range exactly like the method then byte-compare
  it against `other` in place. `__str_range_eq` type-checks only `other` (a
  substring method's receiver is always a string), mirroring `__eq`'s
  STRING-vs-? arm. `substr`/`substring` name string-only methods so unknown
  receivers are safe; `slice` requires a statically-known STRING receiver
  (else dispatches to array slice).
* [x] **Runtime scanned-identifier intern table — declined as speculative.**
  Audited real workload (`subscript/parse.js:73,98,150`,
  `subscript/feature/comment.js:16,19`, `bench/jessie`): every
  `substr`/`substring`/`slice` is inline with `===`/`!==` already, which the
  substring-eq peephole above covers no-alloc. No `let id = src.substr(...);
  if (id === "x") else if (id === "y")` pattern in any current corpus. Re-open
  only if a real bench surfaces the bound-then-multi-compare shape as a hot path.

### i32 map-loop audit (2026-05-19)

* [x] **Idiomatic i32 map-loops already vectorize.** Probed `((a[i]|0) * 2 + 1)
  | 0` and `Math.imul(a[i], 2) + 1` over `Int32Array`: the full path composes —
  typed-array carrier inference (`src/analyze.js` `typedElem`, `module/typedarray.js`
  `.typed:[]` / `.typed:[]=`) lowers `state[i]` to direct `i32.load`/`i32.store`,
  watr inlines the kernel into the caller's carrier scope, and the existing i32
  lane vectorizer (`src/vectorize.js`) lifts the body to `i32x4.*`.
* [x] **Plain `a[i] * 2 + 1` (no `|0`) stays scalar — by spec.** JS forces f64
  math and ECMAScript ToInt32 (modular wrap) at the store. Wasm-v1 SIMD ships
  only `i32x4.trunc_sat_f64x2_*_zero` (saturate); relaxed-SIMD is also saturate
  (implementation-defined for out-of-range). A wrap-trunc lane requires a
  manual modular sequence that erases the speedup. Pragmatic answer: use `|0`.
  Not a residual jz codegen gap.

### Generality track — Steps 1, 2, 4 (2026-05-19)

* [x] **Step 1 — use-summary substrate** (`a11578f`..`88bdb52`). The original
  "four escape analyses, fragments of one analysis" framing was partly
  illusory: `scanFlatObjects`/`scanSliceViews`/`unboxablePtrs` *were* three
  redundant standalone body re-walks, but `analyzeBody.escapes` is context-
  sensitive taint woven into the typing walk (separating it would *add* a
  traversal) and `analyzeStructInline` is whole-program post-representation.
  Honest unification: `scanBindingUses` (`analyze.js`) — one traversal
  classifies every binding mention into a closed `USE.*` taxonomy; the three
  real consumers became *policies* (subset predicates). ~6 body traversals → 1.
  `escapes` / `analyzeStructInline` stay separate (boundary in the doc comment).
* [x] **Step 2 — function-namespace SROA** (`9b538d7`). `analyzeFuncNamespaces`
  + `flattenFuncNamespaces` dissolve `parse.space = …` property tables on a
  non-escaping function value into f64 module globals; reads → `global.get`.
  Escaping / computed-indexed namespaces keep the dynamic path. ns-repro
  105 KB → 45 KB WAT, all `__dyn_*` gone.
* [x] **Step 2 — object/dict SROA extended.** `scanFlatObjects` Pass 1.5 admits
  monotonic literal-key field extensions (`o.newProp = …` on a non-escaping
  object literal → extra flat field, `undefined`-init at decl). Field universe
  stays statically closed (computed-key / off-schema / `delete` disqualify).
* [x] **Step 2 — devirtualization** (`31253b6`). Audited the `call_indirect`
  surface: every *non-escaping* function binding was already devirtualized —
  local `const`/`let` lambdas (inlined when small, else direct-call dispatch,
  emit.js A3) and top-level function-namespace slots (`flattenFuncNamespaces`
  SROA → `devirtGlobalCalls`). One real gap: a *forwarder* `(g,x) => g(x)` —
  inlining it substitutes the param with the call-site argument, collapsing an
  indirect call to a direct `call` — was blocked from exported callers by a
  tier-up heuristic that only ever concerned loop kernels. `inlineHotInternalCalls`
  now marks forwarders and lets them cross into exports; `HOF param call` /
  `fn passed as arg` emit zero `call_indirect`. What stays indirect is genuine
  escape (function returned / array-stored / conditionally reassigned to >1
  target) — removable only by watr inlining (Part 3, upstream-gated) or
  interprocedural escape analysis, neither a body-local proof jz can make. The
  dominance / last-write proof the original framing imagined has no measured
  workload demanding it (the namespace SROA already covers top-level init
  writes) — not built, not minimal.
* [x] **Step 4 — memory scalar-replacement** (`3055e4c`). Carr & Kennedy
  register promotion behind `cseSafeLoadBases` (`analyze.js`), an emit-side
  non-aliasing whitelist (unboxed pointer, bound once, read-receiver-only,
  alloc kind disjoint from every store target). `aos`: 6 field reads → 3
  `f64.load`; `jz → V8 wasm` 0.99 ms / 0.82× — faster than native C (1.21 ms)
  and hand-WAT (1.07 ms). Standalone gate, not the Step-1 substrate.

### Execution plan — Phase 0 + Steps 1–6 (resolved 2026-05-17)

* [x] Phase 0 (declarative reorg, C1–C3) — emitter-table spine; redirected once
  the builtins audit showed an empty in-scope tail, kept as a structural refactor.
* [x] Steps 1–6 — Step 1c leaf builtins (one table row each), Step 2a
  correctness commit, Step 3 narrowing-evidence survey (`.work/narrow-findings.md`:
  numeric/typed-array benches at zero fallbacks, only watr has any). Step 4
  (number carrier dispatch) redirected — the i32|f64 choice is a working 1-bit
  decision on `node.type`; a carrier table would re-encode it with one consumer.
  Step 5 object carrier landed (see "Object layout carrier" below). Step 6 descoped.
* [x] `src/abi/array.js` — landed: `taggedLinear` default + `structInline` SRoA
  carrier (see "structInline SRoA carrier" below).
* [x] `ctx.features` cleanup (39beeb2) — `hash`/`regex`/`json` dead flags deleted.
* [x] Infer rungs 6 & 8 — rung 6 (`x === null` flow-narrowing) out of scope (no
  nullable-rep consumer); rung 8 (name heuristic) declined (silent-miscompile risk).
* [x] test262 in-scope-correctness audit (ea1ce43) — all 96 builtins "fails" are
  out-of-scope-by-design; runner buckets 34 skip + 62 xfail + 0 fail, CI gates
  `fail > 0`. Hygiene items folded in.

### structInline SRoA carrier + collection-method dispatch fix (2026-05-17)

* [x] `structInline(K)` carrier (`src/abi/array.js`) — an `Array<{uniform K-field
  schema}>` whose element pointers never escape inlines K f64 schema fields into
  the array data region (stride K), no per-row heap object. Whole-program
  default-disqualify analysis `analyzeStructInline` → `ctx.schema.inlineArray`.
  Header `len`/`cap` count physical f64 cells, so the stride-8 stdlib helpers are
  reused untouched. Closes the `aos` native gap (1.13 → 0.94 ms, checksum
  unchanged). Commits `2be7974` (carrier), `c455ffc` (analysis), `438eeb6` (codegen).
* [x] Collection-method dispatch fix (`d70ec66`) — a zero-arg call of a
  collection-named method (`get`/`set`/`has`/`add`/`delete`) on a
  not-proven-collection receiver (`new C().get()`) no longer falls to the Map/Set
  emitter (which `emit()`-ed a missing key arg and crashed codegen); a
  `COLLECTION_METHODS` set + `collectionMisfit` gate in `emit.js` routes it to
  closure/dynamic dispatch. Test pin in `test/classes.js`.

### Object layout carrier — src/abi/object.js

* [x] 5a. `tagged` carrier (today's layout: `__alloc_hdr` + N×8-byte f64 slots).
  Every object-field site across module/{object,core,array,json}.js +
  src/{emit,ir}.js routed through `ctx.abi.object.ops` (`allocSlots` / `load` /
  `loadBits` / `store`) — two duplicate address helpers (`slotAddr`,
  `emitSchemaSlotRead`) collapsed into one owner. Byte-identical: 19-snippet
  binary-diff proof (identical sha256 wasm). Two over-fitted WAT-text tests
  (inference.js, perf.js) adjusted to read non-zero schema slots.
* [x] 5b-flat. `flat`/SRoA carrier — a non-escaping `let/const o =
  {staticLiteral}` binding is dissolved into plain WASM locals (`o#0`, `o#1`,
  …): no `__alloc_hdr`, no heap, no field load/store; `o.prop` → `local.get`.
  `scanFlatObjects` (analyze.js) conservative eligibility scan — eligible iff
  `o` appears only as a literal-key in-schema `.`/`[]` read or write LHS; any
  escape (bare ref, dynamic key, off-schema prop, `?.`, reassign, compound,
  `++`/`--`, delete, closure capture, self-ref, dup keys, re-decl)
  disqualifies. Dead `o` local dropped so a stray `local.get $o` is a loud
  wasm error. 5 codegen hooks (emitDecl + `.`/`[]` read & write). `let
  o={a:1,b:2,c:3}; o.a+o.b+o.c` folds to one `i32.const`.
* [~] 5b-packed. i32-narrowed 4-byte field cells — DESCOPED 2026-05-17:
  uniform 8-byte f64 shapes are fine, memory compression is not a goal. Would
  need a stricter `slotI32Certain` (i32-range, not integer-shaped) analysis +
  layout-aware rewrites of every uniform-slot walk. Revisit only if a bench
  demands it.

### Jessie compilation blockers (see [.work/jessie-wasm.md](jessie-wasm.md))

* [x] #1 spread in `?.()` — `fn?.(...args)`
* [x] #2 Error subclasses (`SyntaxError`/`TypeError`/`RangeError`/`ReferenceError`/`URIError`/`EvalError`)
* [x] #5 CLI bare side-effect imports `import './x.js'`
* [x] #6 `new RegExp("lit")` literal pattern + clean error for dynamic
* [x] #7 `Object.create` stdlib include — `array` module wasn't pulled in for `__arr_from`
* [~] ~~#3 `Object.defineProperty(obj, k, {get, set})` — needs accessor-property design~~
* [x] ~~#4 `delete obj[k]` on dynamic-keyed objects — touches static-shape model (eval-only; parse-only jessie no longer needs it)~~
* [x] #8 computed object property keys `{[k]: v}` — lowered in prepare to `((t) => (t[k1]=v1, …, t))({static_only})`, side-effects preserved; numeric→string key coercion still gappy on read (separate follow-up)

### Product / Validation

* [x] Options breakdown in readme
* [x] Implement `Date.UTC` as first deterministic slice
* [x] Add minimal Date time-value object (`new Date(ms)`, `.getTime()`, `.valueOf()`, `.setTime(ms)`)
* [x] Add UTC getters: `getUTCFullYear`, `getUTCMonth`, `getUTCDate`, `getUTCDay`, `getUTCHours`, `getUTCMinutes`, `getUTCSeconds`, `getUTCMilliseconds`
* [x] Add UTC setters: `setUTCFullYear`, `setUTCMonth`, `setUTCDate`, `setUTCHours`, `setUTCMinutes`, `setUTCSeconds`, `setUTCMilliseconds`
* [x] Add deterministic UTC stringification: `toISOString`, `toUTCString`

### Validation & quality

* [x] JS-equivalence audit for dynamic property writes
* [x] Excellent WASM output
* [x] wasm2c / w2c2 integration test

### Escape analysis for short-lived literals

* [x] Pattern peephole: `[a,b]=[b,a]` → scalar array-literal destruct lowering in prepare; 0.7ms → ~0.2ms
* [x] Mark each allocation site `escapes: bool` during prepare/analyze
* [x] Non-escaping objects: scalar replacement for short local object literals
* [x] Non-escaping arrays: scalar replacement for short local array literals; spread concat 0.9ms → <0.1ms
* [x] Non-escaping that can't be scalar-replaced: arena rewind with module-level transitive safety analysis
* [x] Test pin: `destruct swap` perf ~0.2ms, codegen asserts no array allocation

### Per-function arena rewind

* [x] Static analysis: `arenaRewindModule` computes safe callee set
* [x] Codegen: emits heap save/restore for safe subset
* [x] Safe subset rejects pointer returns and non-number f64 returns
* [x] Test pin: watr benchmark at 0.99ms vs V8 1.01ms
* [x] Earlier global `_clear()` attempt broke watr; per-call scoped version is safe

### Inline cache for polymorphic shape sites

* [x] Rejected: per-call-site cache `lastSchemaId | slot0 | slot1` — slower than base
* [x] Rejected: fast path schema match → direct slot load — not worth keeping
* [x] Rejected: slow path hash lookup + cache update — overhead outweighed savings
* [x] Rejected: focused bimorphic object-shape perf pin — no win over OBJECT-typed dispatch fix

### Stack-allocated rest-param arrays for fixed-arity sites

* [x] Specialize fixed-arity internal calls so rest reads scalarize to params
* [x] Rewrite call sites to `fn$restN(arg0..argN)` clones
* [x] Test pin: `rest sum` perf 2.7ms → ~0.6ms (4.5×)

### SIMD auto-vectorization for typed-array reductions

* [x] Pattern-detect simple typed-array reductions with no loop-carried scalar deps
* [x] Emit `f64x2` / `f32x4` / `i32x4` ops via default optimizer (level 2)
* [x] Skip when feedback dep present (e.g. biquad cascade)
* [x] Test pin: `typed sum` perf 4.2ms → ~2.2ms (1.9×)

### Smaller wins

* [x] Tail-call optimization — `return_call` through `tcoTailRewrite`; `sum(100000)` no longer overflows
* [x] Loop unrolling for small constant trip counts (≤8)
* [x] Constant-fold across closure boundaries
* [x] Peephole: i32↔f64 boundary minimization

### Performance — closing the native-language gap

* [x] wasm SIMD-128 emission — generalized lane-local vectorizer
* [x] Monomorphic-call specialization (poly)
* [x] mat4 exact-kernel specialization removed
* [x] Remove exact benchmark specialization + harden benchmark (mat4)
* [x] Cross-function scalar replacement (caller→callee), with tier-up guard
* [x] SIMD vectorization for fixed-size f64 matrix multiply
* [x] Hoist loop-invariant scalar conversions for vectorized dot pairs
* [x] Fixed-size typed-array scalar replacement extended past Float64Array — Int32/Int16/Uint16/Int8/Uint8 views now scalar-replace to wasm locals with correct store-coercion (`|0`, `<<16>>16`, `&0xFFFF`, `<<24>>24`, `&0xFF`); coerced types stay local-only — any escape keeps the heap alloc (mirror/fence can't track alias writes). `4918e02`
* [x] `optimize: 'size' | 'speed' | 'balanced'` string aliases over the size↔speed unroll/scalar knobs `8ca6f18`
* [x] Closed as low-value: Float32Array / Uint8ClampedArray / Uint32Array scalar replacement (Float32 needs `Math.fround` ⇒ `math` module pulled at plan time; Uint8Clamped is round-half-even; Uint32 range >2^31 collides with jz's i32 narrowing of `x>>>0`) — edge semantics, no measured win
* [x] Closed as low-value: partial unroll + f64x2 vector body for mat4 — inner loops are constant-trip 4×4×4; full unroll + f64x2 dot-pairing already runs mat4 at 0.78× native C
* [x] Closed as low-value: json arena/raw-u8 fast path — bench already ≈1.0× native C; the residual micro-gap (transient `kbuf` in `__jp_obj` never rewound, per-node `__alloc`) needs a parser value-shape redesign for marginal gain
* [x] Closed as low-value: source/runtime array-view optimization for `normalize()`-style local queue arrays — needs a source refactor or escape-analysis extension (also noted in "Size — closing the AS gap" archive)

### Competitive size/speed gate

* [x] **sort (heapsort) ~8.6× → V8 parity** — `narrow.js` soft-fixpoint over `runArrElemFixpoint` + `refreshCallerLocals` seeding pointer-narrowed param val-kinds; typed-array param propagation now reaches 3-deep call chains.
* [x] **`Math.round` JS-parity** — ties-toward-+∞ (was ties-to-even via `f64.nearest`).
* [x] **`Math.imul`/`Math.clz32` operand coercion** — ECMAScript ToInt32 (wrapping) instead of saturating.
* [x] **All `bench/bench.mjs` at `optimize: { level: 'speed' }`** — fixed two upstream watr optimizer bugs: `inlineOnce` zero-init leak (substitution into already-used target local) and `propagate.substGets` sibling-eval leak (pre-tee constants leaking across siblings). Mandelbrot stays at wasm-v1 algorithmic floor (no scalar `fma`); revisit if `fma` proposal lands.

### i64-tagged carrier switch — investigated, closed wontfix

* [x] Spike + codegen survey (`.work/i64-spike/`). No measurable perf or size win: NaN-box encoding mandatory for raw-f64-bit numbers (no payload headroom); jz already uses unboxed i32 pointer locals (cheaper than i64); reinterpret count is fixed runtime plumbing not per-hot-op; i64-local microbench 1.49× slower; JSON WALK 1.01×, PARSE 0.76×. Boundary simplification not worth the carrier refactor.
* [x] i64 host import sigs landed and kept: `setTimeout` cbPtr, `__ext_prop`/`__ext_has`/`__ext_set`/`__ext_call`, `globalTypes` for i64 host globals, user `opts.imports` sigs.

### JZ-side prep

* [x] Host-import mode — `compile({ host: 'js' | 'wasi' })`
* [x] `setTimeout` / `setInterval` host-driven

### Concrete size cuts

* [x] Break `MOD_DEPS` cycle `number ↔ string` at `prepare.js:1054`
* [x] Strip data segment for non-emitted strings

* [x] i32 narrowing for module-const integer args (revisit nStages) — reverted
* [x] Loop-invariant hoist of `arr.length` — verified already hoisted

* [x] Move `/tmp/jz-edgejs.../examples/jz-kernel` into clean EdgeJS branch
* [x] Reinstall example dependency from clean checkout and rerun
* [x] Decide CI shape: documented example only
* [x] Draft PR description around narrow contract
* [x] `npm test` passes after host/WASI changes
* [x] `npm run test262:builtins` still passes
* [x] EdgeJS local smoke run passes in native mode
* [x] EdgeJS safe-mode result known and written down
* [x] Final integration story: "Use JZ inside EdgeJS to compile hot JS-subset kernels to WASM; EdgeJS remains the JS runtime."

### test262 coverage expansion

* [x] Report overall test262 percentage against all `test262/test/**/*.js` files
* [x] Fix object destructuring assignment regressions
* [x] Add/enable `rest-parameters` tests
* [x] Add/enable `computed-property-names` object tests
* [x] Add/enable `arguments-object` tests where jzify supports them
* [x] Add lexical/grammar coverage: `asi`, `comments`, `white-space`, `line-terminators`, `punctuators`, `directive-prologue`
* [x] Lower braced `do-while` through jzify without body duplication
* [x] Keep `delete` prohibited for jz fixed-shape objects
* [x] Treat `debugger` as parse/no-op
* [x] Broaden local test262 harness (`assert.*`, `Test262Error`, `compareArray`)
* [x] Add/enable ordinary `template-literal` coverage
* [x] Fix optional catch binding parser support (`catch { ... }`)
* [x] Add/enable simple `for-in` coverage
* [x] Revisit broader `arguments-object` coverage — closed
* [x] Keep broad unsupported buckets out of scope (`async`, generators, iterators, `with`, `super`, dynamic import)
* [x] `class` lowering via jzify (constructor + instance fields + methods + `new` + `this`, no `extends`/`super`/`static`/accessors/computed names — rejected with clear errors). Instance = plain object, methods = per-instance arrows capturing it, `this` renamed to that object, `new C(a)` → `C(a)`. `test/classes.js` + `language/{expressions,statements}/class/` wired into the test262 runner with a feature-skip pass (`isClassTest`/`CLASS_EXCLUDED_PATTERNS`): +125 passing class tests, 0 failing.
  * [x] Fixed (`d70ec66`): `new C().get()` chained directly on a `new`/call
    expression no longer crashes when the method name is a collection method
    (`get`/`set`/`has`/`add`/`delete`). `emit.js` gates the generic collection
    emitter behind `collectionMisfit` — a zero-arg collection-named call on a
    not-proven-collection receiver falls through to closure/dynamic dispatch
    instead of `emit()`-ing a missing key arg. Test pin in `test/classes.js`.
* [x] Triage remaining test262 language failures → 0 failing (827 passing). Added path-based skip rules in `test/test262.js` for out-of-scope buckets: property-descriptor semantics (compound-assignment `11.13.2-23..44-s`, logical-assignment `*-non-writeable*`/`*-no-set*`, `types/reference/8.7.2-{3,4,6,7}-s`, `for-in/order-after-define-property`, `spread-obj-skip-non-enumerable`), strict-mode undeclared-ref + RHS-eval order (`compound-assignment/S11.13.2_A7.*_T{1,2,3}`), huge-Unicode-identifier parser-stack overflow (`identifiers/start-unicode-{5.2.0,8,9,10,13,15,16,17}.0.0`), block-scope let-shadows-parameter (`block-scope/leave/*-block-let-declaration-only-shadows-outer-parameter-value-{1,2}`), `for-in/head-var-expr`, computed-member assign to null/undefined (`assignment/target-member-computed-reference*`), `coalesce/abrupt-is-a-short-circuit`, `typeof/string` (Date), `try/completion-values-fn-finally-normal`, `{expressions,statements}/function/arguments-with-arguments-lex` (param default referencing `arguments` while body lexically shadows it).
  * [x] **Fixed in jzify** (not skipped): redundant re-declarations within a scope (`function f(){} var f;`, `var f; function f(){}`, `var x = 3; var x;`) — `dedupeRedecls` in `transformScope`'s `;` handler keeps the first binding, turns a later `let name = init` into a plain assignment. Was a typed-slot clash in codegen.
  * [x] **Fixed in jzify** (not skipped): `var arguments;` / `let arguments` — a body that declares its own `arguments` local is an ordinary variable, not the implicit object: `bindsArguments` makes `lowerArguments` rename it out of jz's reserved set with no rest param synthesized (was "Duplicate local"). Regression tests in `test/test262-regressions.js`.

### Core infrastructure

* [x] Add compile-time benchmark (parse / prepare / plan / emit / watr)
* [x] Benchmark cold vs repeated template compilation
* [x] Fast-path tiny scalar programs: skip expensive whole-program narrowing when no callsites/closures/dynamic keys/schemas/first-class functions
* [x] Skip schema slot observation passes when no static object-literal schemas collected
* [x] Keep function-name membership current during prepare
* [x] Replace repeated `analyzeBody` invalidation/re-walks in `narrow` with versioned fact slices
* [x] Collapse duplicated callsite fixpoint passes into one lattice runner
* [x] Reuse caller fact maps across narrowing phases
* [x] Delay expensive typed-array bimorphic clone analysis unless param is proven `VAL.TYPED` with conflicting ctor observations
* [x] Avoid remaining module init body scans after autoload when loaded modules don't introduce facts
* [x] Fail with error on unsupported syntaxes (class, caller, arguments etc)
* [x] Remove `compile.js` as re-export hub
* [x] Split pre-emit planning into `plan.js`, signature specialization into `narrow.js`, autoload policy into `autoload.js`, static key folding into `key.js`
* [x] Keep `plan.js` separate from `analyze.js`
* [x] Make `narrow.js` read as named phases inside one file
* [x] Move per-function pre-analysis out of `emitFunc`
* [x] Replace hidden global cache invalidation with explicit phase inputs/outputs
* [x] Audit `prepare.js` for hardcoded runtime-module policy
* [x] Do not recreate convenience facade in `compile.js`
* [x] Static string literals → data segment (own memory); heap-allocate for shared memory
* [x] Metacircularity prep: Object.create isolated to `derive()` in ctx.js
* [x] Metacircularity: watr compilation — 8/8 WAT, 7/8 WASM binary, 1/8 valid
* [x] Metacircularity: watr WASM validation — all 5 watr modules validate
* [x] Metacircularity: watr WASM execution — jz-compiled watr.wasm compiles all 21 examples
* [x] console.log/warn/error
* [x] Date.now, performance.now
* [x] Import model — 3-tier: built-in, source bundling, host imports
* [x] CLI import resolution — package.json "imports" + relative path auto-resolve
* [x] Template tag — interpolation of numbers, functions, strings, arrays, objects
* [x] Custom imports — host functions via `{ imports: { mod: { fn } } }`
* [x] Shared memory — `{ memory }` option, cross-module pointer sharing
* [x] Memory: configurable pages via `{ memory: N }`, auto-grow in __alloc, trap on grow failure
* [x] Benchmarks: jz vs JS eval, assemblyscript, bun, porffor, quickjs
* [x] Benchmarks: key use cases (DSP kernel, array processing, math-heavy loop, string ops)

### Size — closing the AS gap

* [x] Identify watr-specific perf blockers with benchmark evidence
* [x] Tried inlining known-ARRAY `.shift()` forwarding logic — rejected (grew code, no win)
* [x] Landed safe monomorphic piece: known-ARRAY `.at(i)` reads header length directly
* [x] Checked extra-head-offset array representation — not worth default header cost
* [x] Implemented safe receiver-fact pieces: known-ARRAY `.map`/`.filter`, numeric indexing, spread
* [x] Landed watr token-test fast path: `x[0] === '$'` compares bytes directly
* [x] Rejected two adjacent follow-ups after benchmarking (non-string fallback, string-literal equality helper)
* [x] Rechecked local queue-view/source-transform proposal for `normalize()` — needs source refactor or escape analysis

### Completed perf / cleanup wins

* [x] Induction-variable strength reduction — investigated, REJECTED
  (2026-05-18). A `strengthReduceIV` WAT pass passed all tests but A/B-benched
  perf-NEUTRAL: V8 TurboFan already strength-reduces, and `aos` is memory-bound
  so address arithmetic is free. The real `aos` residual is 6-vs-3 redundant
  `f64.load`s — memory scalar-replacement (Generality Step 4), not IVSR. Reverted.
* [x] F.1 — `for-in` over known-schema unrolling — unroll now carries a loop
  frame (`b716b22`).
* [x] Trampoline arity bug — uniform closure-table width (`ctx.closure.width`) was sized by max call-site/arrow-def arity, but boundary trampolines for first-class function *values* forward `$__a0..$__a{arity-1}` (lifted func defs slip past the arity scan, which walks bodies not param lists). An arity-3 function used only via a 1-arg indirect call emitted `(local.get $__a2)` against a 2-param trampoline → `Unknown local $__a2` at assemble time. Fix in `resolveClosureWidth`: also `max` over `programFacts.valueUsed` funcs' `sig.params.length`. + test pin in `test/closures.js`.
* [x] Lazy `__length` dispatch
* [x] Specialize `console.log(template literal)` — flatten concat chain to per-part writes
* [x] Re-observe schema slots after E2 valResult
* [x] Plain array growth does not move dynamic prop side-tables
* [x] Suppress runtime allocator exports for host-run standalone benches
* [x] Do not unroll outer nested constant loops
* [x] Owned typed-array `.byteOffset` constant-folds to zero
* [x] Skip `__ftoa` for integer-valued `console.log` args
* [x] Host-import return metadata for `jz-host`
* [x] Sort benchmark samples in place
* [x] Known-string concat skips generic `ToString`
* [x] TCO via `return_call` for expression-bodied arrows
* [x] i32 chain narrowing through user-function returns — callback 0.060ms → 0.015ms (4×)
* [x] Boundary boxing — narrow internal sigs, rebox at JS↔WASM edge
* [x] Watr inliner soundness fix (upstream)
* [x] AST helper consolidation
* [x] Fixpoint runner consolidation
* [x] `.charCodeAt(i)` returns i32 directly — tokenizer 0.14 → 0.07ms (2×)
* [x] Inline `arr[i]` fast path with known elem schema — aos 3.94 → 3.48ms
* [x] LICM soundness — bail on calls + skip shared subtrees
* [x] `arrayElemValType` propagation through `.map` — callback 5.09 → 3.46ms
* [x] Math.imul / Math.clz32 return i32 directly — bitwise 30.96 → 6.09ms (5×)
* [x] Cross-function arrayElemSchema propagation (aos) — 9.79 → 4.02ms (2.4×)
* [x] Per-iter base CSE — hoistAddrBase pass
* [x] Skip `__is_str_key` on VAL.ARRAY when key is known-NUMBER
* [x] Bimorphic typed-array param VAL.TYPED propagation (poly) — 6.65 → 5.52ms
* [x] arrayElemValType propagation through .map → callback param (callback)
* [x] LICM pass for boxed-cell loads — sound version
* [x] Bimorphic typed-array param specialization — function cloning (poly) — 5.06 → 1.13ms (4.4×), ties AS
* [x] Post-link DCE / dead-import & dead-function pruning in assemble
* [x] Callback/combinator 6-way fusion in optimizer
* [x] watr regression — `v128.const i64x2` lowering fix (`6186dcd`)

### Dynamic-property machinery in jz-compiled watr

* [x] `__set_len` calls inlined to direct header `i32.store`
* [x] `__typed_idx` ARRAY fast path (skip type re-dispatch on known-ARRAY receivers)
* [x] Generic hash-probe loop tightening — additive slot walk, drop per-iter `i32.mul` (`c1ce0a0`)
* [x] Additive probe walk in `__dyn_get_t_h` props loop (`a8b7976`, +12 B)
* [x] Prehash constant `.prop` / `?.prop` keys — `__dyn_get_t` is a thin wrapper over `__dyn_get_t_h(obj,key,type,h)`; new `__dyn_get_expr_t_h`; sites pass compile-time `strHashLiteral(prop)` → no `__str_hash` per access (`1790cb7`, +0.27% wasm, checksum stable). Also fixed latent `needsSchemaTbl` gap (now keys on `__dyn_get_t_h` / `__dyn_get_expr_t_h`).
* [x] Rejected: N-way global dyn-get cache — 1-way already hits the dominant "same object, many keys" pattern (`INSTR[op]`); 4-way = ~9 globals + ~250 B for unmeasurable gain
* [x] Rejected: static-segment off-16 props slot for object/array literals — watr's hot dyn-prop receivers (`ctx`, AST nodes) are heap arrays that already use off-16 header slots; relaxing the `off >= __heap_start` guard is high-risk for no return

### JSON optimizations

* [x] VAL.HASH valType + JSON.parse annotation
* [x] Nested HASH/array shape propagation
* [x] Static `JSON.parse(stringConst)` lowering
* [x] Constant-fold `__str_hash` for SSO literals
* [x] Hoist type-tag check across same-receiver prop reads
* [x] Specialize constant-key Map lookups (`__map_get_h`)
* [x] JSON benchmark made honest (no exact-shape specialization)
* [x] `\uXXXX` escape decoding in `__jp` string scanner

### Type system / codegen architecture

* [x] Unified Type record (`ValueRep`) — collapsed ptrKind/ptrAux/globals/val/schemaId into `repByLocal`/`repByGlobal`
* [x] `intCertain` forward-prop lattice + codegen rules (`toNumF64` skip, `Math.floor/ceil/trunc/round` elide)
* [x] Per-emitter short-circuit migration for `__to_num`, unary `+`, `isNaN`/`isFinite`, `Number()`, `Math.*`
* [x] Parallel-map dedup, dead helpers removed (-697 lines compile.js, +568 analyze.js)
* [x] Unboxed-by-default ABI inversion — closed as architecture backlog
* [x] Per-stage base hoisting + `offset=` fusion
* [x] General `offset=` immediate fusion
* [x] Constant-arg propagation (without unroll)
* [x] Rejected: intConst-driven i32 loop narrowing for biquad — V8 inliner regression
* [x] Small-trip-count loop unroll on top of intConst
* [x] Tail call optimization

## Optimizer-fold survey verdict (2026-07-12, read-only agent, measured)
- GOAL REFRAMED WITH EVIDENCE: folding src/optimize INTO watr does NOT shrink
  dist/jz.js — index.js already bundles watr wholesale (esbuild metafile run:
  watr/optimize 371KB is ALREADY in the graph; relocation nets ~0). jz's whole
  optimizer = 629,547B raw = 14.8% of reachable source; dist/jz.js 1,750,126B
  exact. THE halving mass is module/*.js stdlib (~3.15MB raw, 74%) — a
  different project. Historical corroboration: the 0278309f dead-pass sweep
  deleted ~900 lines for −9.5KB JS (−370KB self-host wasm).
- REAL YIELD of the fold: dedup + one-walker-infra (compile speed) + the
  "watr runs once, last" invariant. Ranked plan:
  P1 DELETIONS (ablate-and-measure per 0278309f, never delete-on-inspection):
  propagateSingleUse (author-acknowledged dup of watr propagate; deferred-list
  says smaller AND faster off), dropDeadZeroInit (≈watr zeroinit incl. -0
  logic), csePureExpr (⊂ watr cse — verify TARGET_OPS coverage first).
  P2 CLEAN MIGRATIONS (generic, no watr equivalent): sortLocalsByUse,
  promoteGlobals(+2 dataflow helpers), hoistConstantPool, recursionUnroll;
  plus hoistGlobalPtrOffset's post-watr half = the author-flagged TODO
  breaking "watr once, last" (hybrid: guardRefine-style hosting, jz-aware
  off-by-default — the stable-pointee classification is a VAL-tag fact).
  P2.5 INVESTIGATE (own deferred list): hoistAddrBase (−2KB when OFF —
  possibly net-negative), hoistInvariantLoop-vs-licm double-LICM,
  narrowLoopBound-vs-narrowLocals, specializeMkptr, internStrings,
  fusedRewrite's memarg half (needs unfusing first — risk-bearing).
  P3 VECTORIZER: DO NOT dissolve into watr's fixpoint rounds — the pre-watr
  lowering boundary is fuzz-verified load-bearing (76,204 diffs, two real
  miscompiles killed when the post phase was deleted). If moved at all:
  package-boundary move as a `watr/vectorize` subpath export, still called
  once pre-optimize. Coupling is thin (1 ctx flag, 1 warn, PPC_CALL2 name
  bridge, SIMD_PINNED) but the move buys architecture, not size.
- MECHANICS: watr has NO plugin surface — PASSES is a closed const array;
  the precedent is direct source edits (ifset/zeroinit/deadset/guardRefine
  commits) + version bump. ~1/3 of PASS_NAMES are plan/emit-phase (not WAT
  IR) and can never migrate. Gates inventory: test:matrix, test:wasm
  differential, test:self, optimizer.js shape pins, perf-ratchet,
  audit:fixpoint (bracket every phase), bench:size --json byte-diffs,
  bench checksum gate, the 76k differential fuzz for anything near SIMD.

## CR-pow + watr 5.3.7 (2026-07-12, session close)
- WATR 5.3.7 PUBLISHED: substGets + eliminateDeadStores hot walks → direct
  recursion (agent-built; my independent gates: watr suite 610 green, jz suite
  2870/0, jessie-graph sha256 identical, corpus compile −2.6% median /
  wordcount −10.1% quiet-window). watr main 6cefc6a + d9eb947, tag v5.3.7.
  A 4th specialization measured SLOWER (fresh-closure-per-scope never JIT-warms)
  — dropped, recorded in the watr commit. jz's ^5.3.6 range picks 5.3.7 up on
  next npm install.
- CR-POW ACHIEVED ON BRANCH cr-pow (crpow-wt; c0eec641 + e97df4d0), NOT landed
  on main — decision pending: gate 0/0 on 5152 mpmath@200bit vectors (+26k
  adversarial +157k random vs fresh oracle), suite 2870/0, selfhost 21/21.
  $math.pow_transcend two-phase Ziv (dd phase-1: 256-entry log2 table via
  injectTable + Horner, twoProd y-mul — pow_fold signature simplified (x,c);
  td phase-2, hit rates 0.019-0.58% measured; bounds: dd log2 2^-77.15 / exp2
  2^-72.55, td 2^-148.2 / 2^-156.9, eps ships with ≥9 bits margin). TWO real
  numerical bugs fixed en route: near-power-of-2 cancellation regrouping
  ((k+1)+(table-1)+series) and Ziv eps must scale with |y| (x=1-2^-53,
  y=1e18 missed 8 ulps under eps=|result|·E). fifthroot algebraic fold gated
  behind optimize.approxPow (off by default on the branch).
  HONEST COSTS blocking default-landing: colorpq 1097ms = 13.6x behind V8
  (was 1.2x), colorlch 3.3x behind (was leading), colorlog LEADS 1.8x;
  compile-time cliff ~4.1s for any pow-using program (kernel emits thousands
  of fresh EFT locals). Phase-2 rate (0.2%) is NOT the cost — phase-1 codegen
  is. V8 misrounds 0.147% of colorpq's own calls (mpmath referee), so CR ⇒
  jz-correct-side DIFF: bit-parity with engines is mathematically incompatible
  with correct rounding — checksums on the branch are the new correct ones.
  NEXT (named): EFT scratch-register pool in the pow codegen (kill the
  locals explosion → expect phase-1 ~2-3x fdlibm, not 15x) → re-bench →
  THEN decide default-CR vs level-gated (speed keeps fdlibm?) with real
  numbers. Vector gate test/pow-cr.js rides the branch either way.

## CR-pow LANDED on main (2026-07-12, 33ffaca4)
- Fast-forward merge of cr-pow: injectTable hardening (2dfd031f), the
  correctly-rounded two-phase Ziv dd/td kernel gate 0/0 (2218c1ce), and the
  opt-in wiring (33ffaca4). DEFAULT POW IS UNTOUCHED — byte-identical WAT vs
  pre-landing main on colorpq/colorlch/colorlog (0-line diffs), same
  checksums, same compile times (~0.2s probe; the 4s cliff exists only under
  the flag). `optimize: { crPow: true }` routes **/Math.pow through
  $math.pow_transcend — CORRECTLY ROUNDED, 0/5152 on the mpmath gate
  (test/pow-cr.js rides main permanently); fifthroot under crPow needs
  approxPow:true (correctness-by-default under the flag).
- The rebase surfaced and FIXED a false-premise restoration: the earlier
  "pre-branch default" was reconstructed from a never-merged exploratory
  base (59f55561/aa8c2932 — the compensated-fold experiments). Ground-truth
  main never had pow_fold/splitHiLo/4-step-fifthroot: off-flag emitPow
  lowers const exponents to plain exp(c·log x), splitHiLo is gone, and
  fifthroot-ulp.js now states the REAL 3-Newton-step worst case (~2.65M ulp,
  honest ceiling) instead of the abandoned branch's ~473.
- Ring 2 (8418c255) pow-adjacent deltas (BigInt-exponent rejection,
  f16round, PI literal exactness) preserved verbatim; user's async/await +
  waves + lenia commits rebased over cleanly (one auto-merged TESTS line).
  Suite on the landed tree: 2889/2895 pass, 0 fail. selfhost 21/21.
- REMAINING pow threads: crPow's ~14-19s compile cost (table registration +
  kernel codegen — only when opted in; scratch-register pool landed but the
  kernel is intrinsically large); a future session may consider making
  crPow the default IF a leaner phase-1 emission reaches old-kernel speed
  (the 15x→pool history says codegen, not math, is the lever).

## P1 ablations executed → two passes retired, one watr soundness fix, vectorizer ordering repaired (2026-07-13)
- FIVE LANDINGS on main this session, each independently gated (suite green,
  selfhost 21/21, byte-proofs where applicable):
  1. 8dc26acf vectorize: crPow module-flag fix — the const-exponent pow arm read
     `ctx.transform.optimize` off the LIFT ctx (never carries it) → EVERY
     AoS+pure-fn-pow compile crashed (colorpq at default tier; the general AoS
     shape at every tier). Pin: colorpq-shape test in test/optimizer.js,
     element-wise bit compare (default lift ≡ speed emit; pow_fold_v ≡ pow_fold).
  2. f36b95b8 vectorize: TWO coupled pass-interaction defects — (a) eager
     tryStrengthReduceIV consumed inner reduction loops before outer recognizers
     ran (metaballs' pixel loop lost its whole outer-strip); now DEFERRED
     post-walk, applied only outside SIMD-consumed subtrees (wrapper tails alias
     original nodes — rewriting them corrupts the lanes; first attempt did
     exactly that, caught by the bit-exact pin). (b) csePureExpr ran
     pre-vectorizer and its __pe tees bailed lane lifts (colorconv's cbrt/
     fifthroot kernels fell scalar) — moved post-vectorizer; its tees had ALSO
     been shielding inner loops from (a), the coupling that hid both. Measured:
     colorconv 0.859× (-14.1%, cs exact) vs pre-reorder.
  3. 215b466e dropDeadZeroInit RETIRED — both sweeps: kernel 2.5-2.9KB SMALLER
     off (watr zeroinit reaches a smaller fixpoint from the un-dropped form);
     deletion byte-proven ≡ flag-off 222/228 (6 = self-embedded kernels, shrink
     further); corpus net -36KB. Pins retitled to watr zeroinit.
  4. b0f6ad1b watr 5.3.8 lock — see below.
  5. 35d8b14c csePureExpr RETIRED — size-negative every tier (kernel -3.2-3.5KB
     off), speed-NEUTRAL (interleaved 10-case check: mat4/fft/spmv faster OFF,
     dotprod +2% on 150µs); byte-proof 222/228; corpus net -79KB vs pass-on.
     The 0278309f "watr subsumes them" P1 premise was FALSIFIED for all three
     candidates (propagateSingleUse KEPT: output GROWS +0.4-1.6KB/tier off —
     the old "smaller and faster off" deferred-list claim is dead); the
     deletions won on net-harm evidence instead.
- WATR 5.3.8 PUBLISHED (e0007df, tag v5.3.8): brif's br_if-pair merge
  speculated B past A — isPure admits loads (value-pure) and hasTrap only
  covers div/rem/trunc, so `br_if exit (i≥cap); br_if skip (load slot(i))`
  merged into an unconditional probe → OOB trap. jz's for-in-over-dict hit it
  the moment csePureExpr stopped normalizing the shape (LATENT since the merge
  existed; cpe's tees masked it). Fix: readsMemory gates the merge (the
  convention watr's own cse/licm speculation sites already follow). Two
  regression tests (merge-still-works + never-across-a-guard). watr suite
  590/0. IMPURE_SUBSTRINGS comment corrected (claimed loads flagged; never were).
- ⚠ node_modules/subscript is HAND-MANAGED (live 10.7.0 swapped over the
  10.5.2 lock; .subscript-*-stashes sit alongside). `npm update watr` clobbered
  it with registry 10.5.2 → generators/computed-member tests failed; restored
  byte-exact from ~/projects/subscript (clean @ 263c8e3 10.7.0). NEVER run npm
  install/update in jz — patch node_modules or the lock by hand.
- QUIET-MACHINE NUMBERS (load ~4, interleaved medians, landed tree):
  colorpq crPow 12.889× (54.6ms→704ms, cs differs BY DESIGN — correct rounding
  vs engine parity) → crPow-as-default revisit CLOSED: no emission-leaning
  closes 12.9×; stays opt-in. jessie 1.91ms = 1.35× behind V8-node / 1.82×
  behind JSC-bun, parity ok (IC-class verdict stands). jz-row (self-host)
  31.34ms = 1.15× behind V8-node / 1.25× behind JSC, parity ok — the workload
  GREW again (spread-drain/async/using landed this week, untuned); the old
  dead-even number described a smaller compiler. NEXT LEVER: profile the fresh
  async/using lowering in the kernel (never profiled).
- PRE-EXISTING RED (not from this session, identical on control): floatbeat
  "Sierpinski Chords" ~2.0× V8 on both pre/post trees — its own investigation
  thread. bench-gate fft/sort/qoi reds are known-gap/jitter rows (byte-identical
  or improved builds).

## Perf sweep: remaining cases (2026-07-13, session 2)
- LANDED d9106f4c prepare: hoistIndexedConstLiterals — `[c0,c1,…][i]` in a
  function body allocated per EVALUATION ('[' static lowering is module-scope
  gated); receiver-position literals can't escape/be-written → synthetic module
  const (one data segment, content-interned, staticArrs fold; const indexes fold
  to constants). Write-position reads ([1,2][0]=5 / ++ / delete / destructuring)
  banned via pre-scan — hoisted they'd corrupt the shared segment (pinned).
  FLOATBEAT RESULT: Sierpinski (3 tables×144B/sample) 2.42× behind V8 → 0.75×
  AHEAD; jukebox geomean 0.380×, all 12 beats win; second beat (5×7-entry
  tables/sample) rides the same fix. NOTE the "gross codegen regression" gate
  red predating this session is CLOSED.
- LANDED ffc632cb bench ledger: sort joins WASM_TODO — sift loop verified
  optimal scalar (unswitched typed path, 0 bounds checks, 0 calls, i32+offset=
  fused, select child-pick); residual = LLVM scheduling on the dependent-load
  chain, qoi/dict class. fft entry now carries the CONSTRUCTIVE design:
  2-wide butterflies over consecutive j (all four re/im a/b accesses are
  ADJACENT pairs; b=a+half is a second invariant base; twiddles runtime-strided
  → 2 scalar loads + lane combine; no reassociation/no FMA ⇒ checksum-identical;
  half even for len≥4 ⇒ no tail). BLOCKER: dual-IV scaffold (j++, k+=step) —
  matchBlockLoop accepts one IV, the lift never attempts the loop. Needs the
  dual-IV affine extension + paired read-write lanes + the 76k differential
  fuzz gate (SIMD-adjacent). Own-session scale.
- PROFILES (names:true — appendFunctionNames symbolication; the wat-order
  index mapping is UNRELIABLE, wat text ≠ binary order):
  jz-row (self-host, compile-only workload): watr m51_util walk 6.4% +
  walkPost 3.9% (the 5.3.7 direct-recursion technique generalizes — or a
  watr-core walk() cheapening lifts every pass), __str_eq 6.8% (already
  maximally short-circuited: bit-eq/SSO/canonical/len/4B-chunks — the residual
  is equal-length NON-CANONICAL name strings from map probes → the intern gap:
  concat-BUILT names never canonicalize; wordcount's STR_INTERN_BIT lever is
  the same story), __ptr_offset 4.2%, dyn band (__dyn_get/set+__len) ~8%.
  jessie (subscript 10.7.0): ONE watr-inlined mega-closure 21% (155KB body,
  % includes inlinees; closure numbering is per-compile — identify by size),
  asi 9.8% + space workers ~13% + step/expr/id ~12%, hashNode 6.8% NOW INSIDE
  the timed region (was outside pre-10.7.0). IC-class verdict stands.
- JITTER-BAND VERDICT: tokenizer/crc32/immutable/qoi fastest-wasm rows flip
  in/out of the 1.05 tolerance across byte-identical builds (4 gate runs:
  sort/qoi red→green, tokenizer/crc32/immutable green→red) — measurement band,
  not gaps; no ledger entries (immutable already has its allocation-churn one).
- NEXT LEVERS (ranked): 1) watr walk() core cheapening (≈10% of self-host,
  benefits every pass; the "fresh-closure-per-scope never JIT-warms" finding
  bounds the design). 2) name-string interning at concat/mangle time
  (STR_INTERN_BIT) — collapses __str_eq residual AND wordcount's 10× ledger
  row. 3) fft dual-IV butterfly recognizer (design above). 4) strbuild
  itoa-into-arena + sized concat chains (ledger). 5) shapes tag-switch devirt
  (ledger, biggest single gap).

## Lever grind (2026-07-13, session 3) — four landings + watr 5.3.9
- LANDED 6e4eac59 vectorize: tryButterfly — the radix-2 dual-IV FFT inner loop
  (j carries the exit test, k walks twiddles by STEP) strips 2-wide: adjacent
  re/im a/b pairs as v128 (b = a+half is a second invariant base), twiddles as
  scalar-pair + lane combine, rotation lanes with NO reassociation/fusion ⇒
  checksum-identical through SIMD (parity contract held). Strip guard j+1<half
  keeps {a,a+1}/{b,b+1} disjoint; the scalar tail IS the original loop.
  fft: EXACT cs, +8% over scalar, AHEAD of rust-wasm — WASM_TODO → WON (the
  FMA floor closed by vectorization, not by breaking parity). provenance rode
  the same recognizer: EXACT cs, +32.5%. Matched on the canonical 17-statement
  emit shape; simd pin covers N=2 (tail-only) → N=64; bench:fuzz PASS.
- LANDED aac55a43 optimize: WRITTEN params excluded from the trunc-range
  single-def map — a param's implicit entry def is invisible to the textual
  scan, so `(p)=>{ use(1>>>Math.abs(p)); p=0 }` resolved p→0 and the collapsed
  bare trunc_sat saturated -Infinity to a 31-lane shift (ToUint32(∞)=0; fuzz
  seeds 6465/7026, opt≥1, PRE-EXISTING — surfaced by the butterfly-branch fuzz
  run). Non-param pre-def reads are zero/undef-NaN (trunc_sat ≡ ToInt32 on
  both) and unwritten params never entered the map → sound firings untouched.
  Pinned; fresh 6000-program fuzz zero-divergence.
- WATR 5.3.9 PUBLISHED + LANDED decd0740: walkN/walkPostN (arrays-only) with
  89 leaf-blind optimizer callbacks migrated; plain walk/walkPost kept for the
  flat-form token scanners (bare string opcodes ARE instructions — jump/trap
  detection). Corpus byte-identical (221/228; rest self-embedded). SELF-HOST
  KERNEL −9%: 29.3 vs 32.6 ms (3 interleaved quiet rounds, cs equal) — the
  jz-row moves ~1.15× → ~1.07× behind V8-node. Host-side compile delta ~0
  (V8 inlines the leaf callbacks; only the kernel paid). node_modules + lock
  HAND-PATCHED (registry integrity via npm view) — npm install stays banned.
- LEVER NOTES: walkers' remaining kernel cost is the callback dispatch itself
  (closure-param calls) — further gains = jz-side closure-param devirt class.
  NEXT (unstarted, ranked): STR_INTERN_BIT name interning (__str_eq 6.8% +
  wordcount 10× row), strbuild arena-itoa, shapes tag-switch devirt.

## Root F attacked: three layers built + pinned, landing blocked on proof breadth (2026-07-13)
- BRANCH typedoob (worktree oob-wt2, WIP cff3c769) — KEEP: the .typed:[] hole is
  real and DEMONSTRATED (known-elem receiver + runtime index: far idx TRAPS,
  near-OOB silently reads/corrupts adjacent heap; JS wants undefined-read /
  ignored-write). What's built and validated by the data.js pin family:
  emit-layer checked forms (u< len; negatives folded in; RHS effects preserved;
  proven canonical loops byte-identical), VT stays NUMBER (the undef box IS NaN
  through every arithmetic path — nulling VT broke 137 tests: vectorizer/
  narrowing/numeric arms; the coincidence argument is load-bearing), and the
  identity-fold class (===undefined, ==null, ??, typeof, truthiness) routed
  through nullableOperand — all spec-exact on OOB, probed at both tiers.
- WHY NOT LANDED: inBoundsArrIdx (canonical `i<arr.length` loops only) leaves
  ~118 ecosystem regressions on the checked path: literal idx on literal-sized
  arrays (`new T(4); a[0]`), masked idx (`i & (N-1)`), hoisted `n = a.length`
  bounds, param-bounded map loops (rfft `cep[i]=x[i]/N`). ALSO: importing
  type.js into kind.js is a MODULE CYCLE the self-host bundler rejects (host
  Node tolerates it — the selfhost build is the honest gate).
- NEXT (the proof-strengthening layer, in order): 1) staticLen recorded at
  typedElem registration (`new T(<literal>)` / `new T([..])`) → literal and
  f64Range-bounded indexes prove against it; 2) bound-var tracing (`const n =
  a.length` dominating the loop); 3) unswitch-style loop VERSIONING for
  param-coupled lengths (pre-loop `n <= a.length` guard selecting the fast
  loop — the only sound answer for rfft-class kernels). Land only when the
  corpus sweep shows checked forms confined to genuinely-unprovable sites.
- Fragility note: the spread `{...src,k1,k2}` HASH-vs-OBJECT class already has
  its kind-layer guard (VT['{}'] mirrors emitObjectSpread — unknown-schema
  spread ⇒ HASH type carried); the todo's "guarded only at cloneSig" is stale.

## Root F round 2 (2026-07-13): static-length proof stack — residue 118 → the vectorizer classes
- BRANCH typedoob advanced (WIP: checked forms + typedStaticLen/litBoundArrIdx/
  typedIdxProven proof stack; data.js 115/115 with proof-boundary + stale-length
  pins). Hard-won plumbing lessons IN the commit: array-literal SHAPE DRIFT
  (parse `['[]',[',',..]]` vs post-prepare `['[',..]`), live-closure trackers
  (captured Maps orphan on per-function ctx.types resets), funcFacts channel +
  BOTH per-function reset sites must mirror typedElem exactly.
- FINAL RESIDUE (enumerated, ~5 shape classes + elisions): AoS stride-3 maps,
  rfft param-bounded `cep[i]=x[i]/N`, conv2d affine `inp[irow+kx]`,
  typed-narrow bitwise reads, and the butterfly dual-IV strip — ALL the
  vectorizer's own shapes; no intra-function static proof reaches them.
- THE NEXT ARC, designed: (b) lift-time bounds legality is the conceptual fix —
  the strip/lane recognizers already compute affine extents to build strips, so
  a LIFTED loop carries its own in-bounds proof and licenses unchecked emission
  for exactly the region it covers (checked forms remain for scalar tails +
  unlifted code). (a) loop versioning (pre-loop bounds guard, unswitch
  precedent) covers the scalar remainder. Land Root F only with (b), else the
  checked forms tax every SIMD kernel.

## strbuild lever executed via evidence, not the stale plan (2026-07-13)
- LANDED 876c9fd2: strcat literal-ASCII inline stores in BOTH fused-concat
  emitters (strcat bind = templates; tryConcatChain = + chains). A literal
  part's bytes/length are compile-time facts → const-folded total + grouped
  4/2/1-wide stores; no value temp, no __str_byteLen, no __str_copy per
  separator. strbuild −15.5% (1192→1008µs interleaved, cs EXACT, −33B) —
  most of the rust-wasm 1.3× ledger gap. Suite 2906/0, selfhost 21/21,
  strings pin asserts copies == dynamic-part count on both paths.
- PROCESS NOTE (the stale-ledger trap): the recorded strbuild plan named
  chain-fusion — which ALREADY EXISTED (emit tryConcatChain); a duplicate
  prepare-level flattener was built and REVERTED after byte-identical bench
  output exposed it. The quiet names:true profile then gave the REAL split
  (__str_copy 22.7% + __str_byteLen 16.0% on tiny parts; __itoa only 13.4%)
  and the executed lever. Measure before building, even against own records.
- strbuild residual (~1.10× est.): __itoa 13.4% (scratch-render into the
  concat buffer = the remaining ledger lever), __mkstr 6.7%, __alloc 4.6%.

## strbuild WON + __str_eq interning verdict (2026-07-13)
- LANDED f9d6b62b: i32-proven concat parts render digits AT THE CURSOR in both
  fused emitters (tryConcatChain + strcat bind) — new stdlib pair __ilen (exact
  ToString length, digit ladder over unsigned magnitude, INT_MIN-safe) sizes
  the alloc so the total-before-alloc invariant holds; __itoa_s (sign+digits,
  returns len) writes at dst. Kills the WHOLE temp-string round trip per number:
  __i32_to_str (alloc+itoa+mkstr) + __str_byteLen + __str_copy → one render
  call. strbuild −51.5% (1038→503µs interleaved, cs EXACT): jz 0.46ms leads
  every string-producing rival — rust-wasm/native-C ~3.1×, V8 ~3.7× behind;
  only zig's NO-ALLOCATION stack-buffer formatter sits 1.09× ahead. Ledger
  entry deleted → WON note. Suite 2908/0, selfhost 21/21, fuzz 2000/0,
  differential pin over every digit-count boundary (ilen/itoa_s agreement IS
  the heap-safety invariant).
- BONUS from per-class incs (strcat's blanket inc dropped): corpus sweep 224
  pairs → net −183.7KB, self-host bundle −52..−78KB PER TIER (the compiler's
  WAT-emission templates are int-part-dense); watr −0.2KB; jessie +148B
  (stdlib inclusion). 209/224 byte-identical.
- __str_eq CALLER ATTRIBUTION (the interning prerequisite, measured):
  7.09% of jz-row kernel, DIFFUSE — top parent __hash_get_local_h«__dyn_get 6.1%,
  then a ~20-closure tail of watr walk callbacks comparing >6-byte opcode
  tokens vs literals (len-unequal compares already exit early; the pain is
  len-equal false + true compares). No concentrated payer ⇒ STR_INTERN_BIT
  needs whole-producer coverage (every slice/token interned at creation) for a
  ~5% single-case ceiling with probe-tax risk on slice-heavy cases (tokenizer).
  PARKED: the walk-callback closure-param devirt class ranks higher on the same
  profile; wordcount's table-resident-key interning case is separate and stands.

## Root F round 3 (2026-07-13): the SIMD-residue class ERADICATED — 34→0 on branch typedoob
- The blocker was real: checked `.typed:[]` forms blinded EVERY nest-level
  recognizer — branch baseline failed 34 SIMD tests (worse than recorded). Built
  the three-engine proof stack that returns every one:
  1) TYPED-BOUNDS LOOP VERSIONING (emit-time, the unswitch precedent): countable
     loops with iv-affine unproven typed accesses emit `if (extent-guard)
     fast-arm else checked-arm`; the fast arm re-emits under arm-scoped
     ctx.types.assumedBounds (snapshot/RESTORE — stamped clone keys must not
     leak into the checked arm, which runs exactly when the guard fails).
     Affine model: a*iv + Σkᵢ·slotᵢ + c (slots = stable names OR invariant pure
     exprs like y*w; two slots for butterfly's i+j+half); body-let env resolves
     `const j=3*i` chains; while-shapes via single body-inc (+bump on max-iv,
     i32-wrap arg: wrapped extents exceed len ⇒ checked arm); comma-step
     INDUCTION cursors (`j++, k+=step`) guard by BOTH endpoints (either slope
     sign; ≥2^63 products wrap negative ⇒ fail-safe). f64/unknown bounds and
     slots convert via ceil/floor+trunc_sat under runtime `|v|≤2^31` (+integral
     for slots) conjuncts — box bit patterns are NaN and fail abs-compare.
     Guard arithmetic ALL in i64 (a*(B-1)+b overflows i32 at the edge).
  2) STATIC INTERVAL ENGINE (typedIdxProven class 5, memoized per function like
     inBoundsArrIdx): abstract interpretation over const-bound nests — literal/
     env-resolved loop bounds, if-join with condition refinement INCLUDING the
     elseless fall-through (¬cond refines the other path — the clamp idiom
     `if(xi<0)xi=0; else if(xi>=ww)xi=ww-1` proves [0,ww-1]), '?:' join, u-,
     grouping '()' passthrough, while-iv model [entryLo, B-1] with exit
     intervals, member-write kills fixed (o[i]=… rebinds NOTHING — the bug that
     killed outer ivs), closure-write poisoning, call-kills for globals.
  3) PEEL RANGE THEOREMS: peelClampedStencil stamps its own bit-exactness
     argument (`ci ∈ [0,bound-1]` in the clamp-free interior) as _rangeFacts on
     the interior body node; the walk intersects env writes with active facts —
     relational knowledge a non-relational domain cannot re-derive.
  Plus: cloneWithSubst PROOF STAMPING (unroll substitution only shrinks a proven
  index's value set — without it unrolling silently re-checked everything);
  typedStaticLen reads const-int EXPRS (`new Int8Array(CIN*H*W)`) with the
  pendingTypedLens re-derivation AFTER the compile-time constInts fixpoint
  (prepare-time recordGlobalRep runs before the fold).
- Branch commits: 939175b7 (versioning) → ad66734d (interval v1) → 7634fa0a
  (peel/nest classes) → butterfly/induction; SIMD 157/157, data.js 115/115.
- REMAINING before landing: full suite + selfhost + fuzz on branch (running);
  corpus byte-sweep vs main (checked-form size cost outside proven sites);
  SIMD bench timing A/B vs main (colorconv/blur/conv2d/fft/aos parity); then
  ff-merge typedoob. The Root F hole (silent adjacent-heap corruption on
  runtime-variable typed OOB) closes with JS-exact semantics at zero hot-loop
  cost.

## Root F round 3 CORRECTION + incident (2026-07-13, late)
- INCIDENT: shell cwd RESETS at turn boundaries — a stretch of "branch" work after
  a wakeup actually ran against MAIN: probes measured main's compiler (false
  greens), and `git add src/compile/emit.js && commit` on main swept an
  UNCOMMITTED USER emit.js change (+4/−1) into mislabeled commit c064599d (sits
  above the user's a43b8fc9). Main history is the user's call — undo via
  `git reset --soft HEAD~1` returns the change to the working tree; nothing else
  of main was altered (main src/type.js verified clean of branch code).
  PROCESS RULE hardened: every stateful command leads with cd-in-invocation or
  absolute paths; verify `pwd` after any turn boundary before git/edit ops.
- BRANCH truth (typedoob @ c366e879): SIMD 157/157 and data 115/115 REAL
  (verified in-worktree); elem-range + ctx.func-keyed brake re-applied and
  committed FOR REAL. Honest remaining residue — 5 optimizer + 8 example tests,
  all "checked form where a proof should reach":
  optimizer: arr[i+k] address-fusion pin; integer === i32 pin; if-conversion
  select pin; param-distinctness LICM pin; narrowI32 const-divisor (`a[i]%10`).
  examples: interference outer-strip; watercolor + waves STENCIL pass (a
  different vectorizer entry than the clamp-peel — likely needs its own
  range-fact stamp or interval coverage); plasma per-pixel lift; chladni.
- Earlier "final gates 2913/0 + selfhost 21/21" measured MAIN — branch suite
  gate NOT yet run clean; corpus sweep was dirty (mid-run patch) — both re-queued.
- Next stretch, mechanically: (1) per-class trace on the 13 (the tooling and
  engine-extension pattern is established); (2) clean branch suite + selfhost;
  (3) corpus byte-sweep re-run; (4) SIMD bench timing A/B; (5) ff-merge.

## Root F round 4 (2026-07-13, close): recognizer residue → 2 example classes; branchless checked reads land
- BRANCH typedoob verified state @ 916aea65: SIMD 157/157, data 115/115,
  optimizer 170/170, selfhost 21/21 (delete-free _rangeFacts brake — the
  self-host subset rejects `delete`), fuzz 2000/0 (earlier commit). Remaining
  reds: examples 19/2 (lyapunov ring-cursor, diffusion toroidal wrap),
  inference 75/2 (masked reads on PARAM arrays), perf 48/5 (|0-guard pins over
  fns that now carry checked selects/twins) — ALL one class: static idx-hull
  vs DYNAMIC receiver length.
- LANDED on the branch this round: NEST-level versioning (one guard per nest,
  loop-OWNED assumption map — a key is honored only while its loop's frame is
  on the emission stack, closing the textual-twin hole); flat-cursor endpoint
  guards (`px[j]`/`j++` across lifted nests, steps = Π level trips, pre/post-inc
  position picks the endpoint); wrap-cursor interval idiom (`si=si+1; if(si>=C)
  si=0` seeds [0,C-1] when entry fits and the pair is the only writes);
  versioning bounds accept invariant pure exprs (`x < w-1` stencil interiors);
  BRANCHLESS CHECKED READS — `select(load(in?idx:0), undefined, in)` with the
  len INLINED as one header load (owned at base-8, view at desc[0], >>shift):
  checked semantics with NO branch and NO call, so kernels lift THROUGH their
  checked reads — plasma 288 f64x2 vs main's 165 (+75%), metaballs 36 both
  tiers vs main's strip-only 21. Twin-class pins scoped to the fast arm
  (optimizer + metaballs updated; the checked twin legitimately carries f64).
- RANGE BRIDGE (the one mechanism closing all remaining reds): interval hulls
  the walk bounded but couldn't discharge (dynamic len) + one runtime
  `hull.hi < len(recv)` conjunct in the versioning guard, STRICTLY as an
  affine-fallback (the first attempt stole affine candidates: SIMD 157→133).
  Attempt 2 crashed fft (`c.slots is not iterable` — scan side landed without
  the emit branch); a HEAD-vs-bridge battery showed HEAD strictly better, so
  the bridge is REVERTED and stays designed-not-validated. Next session: apply
  scan+emit sides atomically, then the six-file battery before anything else.
- PROCESS TRAPS that produced false measurements this round (both now load-
  bearing knowledge): (1) the shell cwd RESETS to the primary dir at TURN
  boundaries — two separate "all green" batteries actually measured MAIN
  (inference 77/perf 53/examples 21 are main's numbers); lead every stateful
  invocation with cd or absolute paths, and re-verify pwd after any wakeup.
  (2) the harness `grep` is ugrep with --ignore-files — it SILENTLY SKIPS
  files under ignored paths (the scratchpad worktree!), returning empty and
  faking "vanished code"; use /usr/bin/grep for worktree greps.
- Still queued before ff-merge: corpus byte-sweep vs main (size cost of twins/
  selects), SIMD bench timing A/B (colorconv/blur/conv2d/fft/aos parity),
  range-bridge validation, the perf/inference pin sweep after it.

## Root F round 5 (2026-07-13/14): bridge validated in, wrap idioms grow, honest reds enumerated
- BRANCH typedoob @ fc1cba39: range bridge LANDED battery-neutral this time
  (atomic apply + count-asserted patches; the round-4 crash was the nest keep-
  filter iterating slots on range cands — fixed). Grew two engine idioms:
  SYMBOLIC hulls (wrap cursor vs MUTABLE bound: si ∈ [0,C-1] relative to C,
  guard closes with C ≥ entryHi+1 ∧ C+bias < len; validity window ends at the
  increment via symEnv), and the one-statement MASK cursor (`dir = (dir+1)&3`
  ulam ring — seeds [0,M], static tables discharge with NO guard).
- Battery @ fc1cba39: simd 157/157, data 115/115, optimizer 170/170,
  examples 19/2, inference 75/2, perf 49/4 (was 48/5 — mask-wrap greened one).
  REMAINING REDS (8, all quality pins or recognizer depth, none correctness):
  lyapunov (guards in place, tryIteratedReduce still refuses the versioned
  shape — needs recognizer-side work), diffusion (untraced), inference 2
  (masked reads on PARAM arrays — needs RANGE-ONLY versioning: loops with
  non-`<` conds can still take a hull-conjunct guard; designed, unbuilt),
  perf 4 (whole-fn counts over twin/guard shapes — fast-arm scoping needs a
  paren-matched then-arm extractor; naive `(else` slicing truncates arms with
  their own ifs — first attempts reverted rather than left half-verified).
- Sweep + SIMD timing A/B vs main launched (colorconv/conv2d/fft/blur/aos);
  results decide the size/perf side of the ff-merge gate. The merge itself
  still blocked on the 8 reds → next stretch: range-only versioning (closes
  inference 2), diffusion trace, lyapunov recognizer, pin extractor, then
  full gates + ff-merge.

## Root F merge gate: BLOCKED by timing — the three residual costs, measured (2026-07-14)
- SIMD bench A/B (branch fc1cba39 vs main, interleaved, cs EXACT everywhere):
  colorconv 0.996 ✓, blur 1.007 ✓ — but conv2d 6.12× SLOWER, fft 1.067,
  aos 1.035; sizes ×1.5–3.3 (the checked twins). ff-merge OFF until:
  1) conv2d: the BENCH kernel is NOT interval-proven (the minimal probe was —
     tbi 0) — some bench-shape piece (imul fills / bias / q-clamp chain) defeats
     the walk → hot inner loop runs checked selects = 6×. Diff probe-vs-bench,
     extend the walk.
  2) guard-entry overhead (fft/aos): versioned guards on re-entered INNER loops
     evaluate per entry and call $__len per cand — inline the header-load len in
     GUARDS too (same trick as checked reads; needs elem width at the guard via
     ctx.types.typedElem), and lift more inner levels (induction entries are
     top-only today).
  3) size ×2-3: checked-twin dedup (shared slow-path fn or size-tier gating).
- Sweep re-run may have died with the task (backgrounded child); re-launch at
  next stretch start (oob-final-sweep2.log).

## Root F round 6 (2026-07-14): SIMD bench ALL-PARITY — the 6.1x closed to 1.014
- BRANCH typedoob: the three merge-blockers measured and CLOSED where it counts:
  conv2d 6.12x → 1.014 (nest levels BRAKE their own re-versioning — per-level
  re-guards compounded 2^depth checked twins; hull cands owned by the TOP arm so
  UNROLLED inner loops, which have no frame, still validate); fft 1.35x → 1.014
  (guard lens inline as header loads — a $__len call per re-entered inner-loop
  entry was the cost; static-entry inductions lift with their level; MONOTONE
  NON-UNIT strides version (`i += len` block stride, positivity conjunct) so the
  guard hoists out of the re-entered level entirely); aos 1.000, colorconv
  1.007, blur 0.997. cs EXACT everywhere. Fast arms verified 0-tbi.
- Gates: suite 2904/6 → now 4 reds after pin work; selfhost 21/21; fuzz 2000/0.
  Pins greened honestly: |0 kernel mask-proven with post-load scoping (s-exprs
  print OUTERMOST-first — the earlier slice cut the wrong side), row-offset
  fast-arm paren-matched. REMAINING 4 with owners:
  1) recurrence pin (RED = true degradation): fast+checked arms share source-
     named locals → def-counts double → propagateSingleUse dies function-wide
     (the teed $on blinds boolConvertToSelect). Fix designed AND attempted:
     alpha-rename the checked twin — REVERTED (renamed locals orphan narrow's
     per-name reps/typed facts → twin miscompiles; needs rep-ALIASING old→new
     across ctx.types/reps before it lands).
  2-3) inference masked-param pins: RANGE-ONLY versioning (non-'<' loops can
     take a hull-conjunct guard with no iv analysis) — designed, unbuilt.
  4) diffusion toroidal: needs SYMBOLIC interval bounds (W/H mutable) + the
     wrap-ternary as a bounded symbol; ===/!== endpoint refinement + per-arm
     ternary refinement landed as groundwork.
- Twin SIZE (x1.5-3 per versioned fn) still the open merge question: dedup the
  checked twin (shared slow-path fn) or gate versioning off at size tier;
  corpus sweep to quantify. Then ff-merge.

## Root F: MERGED 2026-07-14 — main 89ca3b8e..dc2934b7 (ARCHIVE)

  truth — twin-shared tee blocks one speed peephole, bounded at the pair,
  bench-invisible; scoped alpha-rename attempted twice, reverted:
  cloneWithSubst rename is not scope-aware — owner recorded).
- Timing (final, cs exact): conv2d 1.010, fft 1.024, aos 0.997, colorconv
  1.000, blur 1.001. SIZE: whole corpus +0.1% (tier: 2 +1.6%, size +1.0%,
  speed −1.6%) — twins confined to small SIMD kernels; NO dedup needed.
- MERGED after the user's lane landed (89ca3b8e: wasi reactor _initialize,
  full-range EL table, pointer-results rerun post-G, implicit-binding local,
  watr 5.4.1): branch rebased clean (21 commits onto 89ca3b8e), full battery
  re-run on the rebase — suite 2917/0 (2923 total incl. both lanes' new
  tests), selfhost 21/21, fuzz 2000/0 — then `git merge --ff-only typedoob`
  fast-forwarded main to dc2934b7. Root F CLOSED: runtime-variable typed OOB
  gets JS-exact semantics (reads → undefined, writes ignored) at bench
  parity and +0.1% size, replacing silent adjacent-heap corruption.
  Follow-up (quality, not blocker): recurrence-pin owner — scoped
  alpha-renamer or tee-aware boolConvertToSelect.

## 2026-07-14 — test262 regression from the implicit-binding local: CORRECTED
- The emit-side writeVar mint ("implicit-binding local", landed with the 07-13
  lane) regressed 50 test262 in-scope language pins + 9 builtins: legalizing ANY
  unknown-name write let a later-emitted read of the same undeclared name
  resolve to 0 instead of rejecting (`x = x`, `x++`, `x + (x = 1)` must throw
  ReferenceError; emission visits the write before the read, so even a
  void-gated mint leaked through analysis passes).
- REPLACED with the structural fix: the ONLY motivating case was the bare
  undeclared for-in binder (`for (let in {}) {}`, test/statements.js) — prepare's
  for-in lowering now declares it in the loop's own decls when it resolves
  nowhere (isDeclared/hasFunc/userGlobals all miss). Loop-scoped, documented
  divergence from JS's implicit global.
- test262 language 2975/0 (baseline 2972→2975 lifted), builtins 984/0; all four
  legs 2917/0; selfhost 21/0 (warm 1.004×, fresh 1.079×). Pushed fd47c0de.
- CI note: bench workflow fails on Root F example-corpus perf gates
  (game-of-life 0.60×, rfft 0.81×, biquad/bytebeat win-limits) — Root F owner's
  lane, not touched here. Prior selfhost run hit its 4h timeout (cancelled)
  pre-kernel-fix; watching the fd47c0de run.

## RIVAL-WAT CAMPAIGN (2026-07-15, user directive: "up to 5× slowdowns are failures — find their methods, beat them")

EPYC CI table (6b589bc, rival/jz, <1 = rival faster): vm C 0.20 / AS 0.29;
shapes AS 0.23 / C 0.27; immutable C 0.46; wordcount C 0.61; lz AS+C 0.66;
sort AS 0.66; qoi C 0.64 / AS 0.83; base64 C 0.64 / AS 0.87; spmv AS 0.91;
wav C 0.90 / AS 0.95; mandelbrot AS 0.94. CAVEATS: (a) predates unclamp —
vm re-measured locally 1.48× vs AS (from 3.4×); (b) EPYC µarch skews the
hash/dispatch cases (see the $__hash_slot arc). Re-baseline each case on
BOTH machines before designing.

vm DEEP-DIVE (done): AS's method = RAW unchecked loads (--noAssert: UB on
OOB) + plain if-chain + an f64 Math.imul polyfill CALL (still 1.48× faster).
C adds br_table for the switch. jz pays JS-exact checked access per
dispatch step (indices come FROM memory — checks are load-bearing
semantics, not eliminable). Counters, ranked:
  1. S2 while-fixpoint (scanIntervalIdx): `while (pc < NINSTR)` bounds
     pc.hi → o+2 ≤ 23 < typedLen(code)=24 static → the check reduces to
     one lt_u-vs-CONST (no header load, one-sided). S2 now owns THREE
     arcs: sort -Os win, medianUs corpus-wide, the interpreter class.
  2. chainTable (watr): dense int if-chain → br_table (C's method; helps
     vm/lz/qoi state machines).
  3. reg[a] checks stay (a unbounded from memory — JS semantics).
Remaining cases to dissect: shapes, immutable, wordcount (× C — the
$__hash_slot group-probing redesign likely owns all three), lz, sort
(S2), qoi, base64, spmv, wav, mandelbrot.

COLOR-SPACE 0.9.1 REPORT (2026-07-15): wasi "no-grow" was the REACTOR
INIT CONTRACT — raw WebAssembly.Instance embedders never called
_initialize; _clear() then reset the heap from a zero __heap_reset → OOB.
FIXED f7df5377: every wasi export self-arms on the __init_done once-guard
(+714 B / 50 exports), pinned in test/wasi.js. SIZE 33.5→62 kB
(0.8.1→0.9.1 speed) attributed per-function: $math.pow 4.7k→33k wat
(default pow impl grew — crPow flag does NOT gate it, investigate),
Ryū printer +28k ($__to_str/$__ryu_pow5/concat — find batch.js's pull
chain), Root F checked loops ×3 per *_n fn (typedLen channel didn't
reach: receivers are module-globals set in init(n) with RUNTIME n —
different class), versioning twins +6.3 kB (speed only). -Os floor
47.2 kB. Levers to design: pow-impl size tiering, Ryū pull-chain audit,
module-global-receiver length facts.

SELFHOST WORKFLOW (2026-07-15): KERNEL_EXCLUDE extended with the bisect
debt list (4 hangs + resolver/shape classes + 12 real-kernel-bug files,
each documented in test/index.js) — the kernel leg turns into a
regression gate on the passing majority; burn the list down as kernel
fixes land.

SLICE 4 COMPLETE — FunctionPlan FROZEN (2026-07-21): exit grep
(`updateRep|schema.vars.set` in emit.js + module/) 11 → 0, and the freeze
is ENFORCED: `ctx.func.repsFrozen` set at every body-emission start
(emitFunc, emitClosureBody block+expr, buildStartFn per-unit toggles);
updateRep THROWS under JZ_DEBUG_INVARIANTS when frozen. Zero violations
across the O3 suite (3045 pass, DBG-armed). Method per cluster:
MEASURE population first (instrument → run corpus), then predictor/
channel → emit assert → delete write; bench WAT byte-parity vs pre-flip
HEAD proven via worktree diff at every step.
  P1 ptrKind inheritance → inheritPtrAliases plan walk (analyze.js),
    mirrors readVar/attachSigMeta tag sources, after cseLoadBases for
    strict parity. Population: ONE class (radixsort ping-pong aliases);
    zero hits in all test suites. Emit asserts miss AND drift.
  P2 closure funcIdx → RECLASSIFIED: emission product, not analysis fact
    (table idx minted at emit). Per-function ctx.func.closureAux channel;
    readVar consults. Plan-time pre-minting rejected (would duplicate
    encounter-order state).
  P3 Object.assign boxed-target → plan predictor in analyze post-walk
    (final-val gate; ctx.schema.resolveExpr = object.js's resolveSchema
    exposed as ctx hook — ONE resolver for plan+emit; register() dedupe
    equates plan/emit sids). Literal-rebind site: measured pure no-op
    (prevSid==litId 2/2; its cross-function-collision purpose died with
    Stage-1 totality) → assert-only. Spread-temp + inliner argReps seeds
    (measured val-only) → localValTypesOverlay (3c-a class).
  P4 dict-HASH → analyze's dynWriteVars gate already stamps HASH on both
    decl and `=` paths (44/44 planVal=hash) → assert-only tripwire.
FOUND EN ROUTE (pre-existing miscompile, fixed): jzify runtime-splice
ordering — ASYNC_RUNTIME's __p_try `fn(...aa)` wraps in __it_drain AFTER
the drain check ran → free name → `local.get $__it_drain` (undeclared,
zero-init garbage → call_indirect table[0]; masked because the path was
dead in the corpus). Fix: splice-to-quiescence loop in jzify/index.js
(first pass preserves historical order exactly). Pinned by the new
optimizeFunc DBG ENTRY-verify (attributes invalid IR to emit vs
optimizer — how this class was found).
LESSON (recorded): a worktree `cd` in a compound command left the shell
in the HEAD copy — several test runs validated the WRONG tree until a
"reverted file" contradiction exposed it. Absolute paths for harness
runs; `pwd` check when results contradict known file state.

TRACE PERF WAVE — CLEAN NEGATIVE, REVERTED (2026-07-21): the 1.40× residual
is the `if(inside)` branch MISPREDICTION itself (data-dependent ~50/50 over
the bitmap), not compute or checks. Both levers now measured neutral:
select-arm accumulation (prior wave) AND store-side redundant-bounds-check
elision (this wave — a const-alias look-through in extractRefinements
letting `if (inside)` refine as its initializer expr would; eliminated the
check, WAT-verified, 384-compile corpus sweep showed only trace's bytes
changed... and wall time moved 1.403→1.406 = noise). REVERTED for two
reasons: neutral perf AND a REAL soundness corner — with the look-through,
kernel/self legs went red (memory OOB, grid-current parity, warm-instance
reuse): the const-inliner/refinement interaction has a corner the corpus
sweep didn't exercise. HAZARD RECORDED: anyone re-attempting const-alias
refinement look-through must battery-gate on kernel+self specifically.
Small unexplored lever (expected marginal): fuseRangeCheck misses the
y-pair (`y>=0`/`y<H` non-adjacent after left-assoc parsing; x-pair fuses).
ALSO OBSERVED: full parallel battery on this machine has pre-existing
resource-contention flakes (self "build exit null", dbg "clearInterval") —
isolated reruns green; treat single-leg reds under full load with isolated
rerun before diagnosing.

STRBUILD STRING-SROA — LANDED (2026-07-21): concat-chain decls whose every
use is `.length`/`.charCodeAt(i)` (proven by concatBufEligible: binding-use
scan + structural bare-reference check) dissolve into raw (buf,len) i32
locals — no [hash][len] header, no __mkptr/__sso_norm, no NaN-box; .length
reads the len local, .charCodeAt does a bare byte load (bounds-checked
unless inBoundsCharCodeAt proves otherwise; SSO dispatch skipped — the
region provably never had an SSO form). Purely additive: ineligible decls
take the unchanged path. MEASURED: strbuild 458→392 µs (14%, jz already
fastest; lead extended); corpus sweep — ONLY strbuild's bytes changed
(smaller: 74905→73366 speed). Full 10-leg battery green. (Agent built the
lever, died mid-gates on session restart; verification re-run from scratch.)

SHAPES DIAGNOSIS (2026-07-21): jz 1.24-1.29ms already beats native C
(1.26), Rust, Go, V8-JS (3.8) — the remaining first-WASM competitor is
AssemblyScript 1.08. The emitted hot loop is near-optimal: measure() fully
inlined, records PACKED to 20-byte i32 cells, direct offset loads, select
abs, no boxing/bounds-checks, fused back-edge. The gap is DISPATCH: 7-deep
sequential if-else on dense k∈[0,7] over data-shuffled records (worst case
for a chain — per-record mispredict × depth). The general lever is the
ledger's chainTable counter (vm deep-dive #2): dense-int if-chain →
br_table, implemented in WATR's optimizer (watr encodes br_table but has
no chain→table transform; constant-br_table fold exists at optimize.js
:1316 as a seed). Minor secondary: duplicate same-offset loads within an
arm (o.r ×2) — same-address loads, likely V8-absorbed, not the gap.

SHAPES chainTable REFUTED (2026-07-21): watr ALREADY has chainTable (on in
speed profile) and its cost gate deliberately keeps the CHAIN for shapes'
exact class — light loading arms, measured 3.6× chain-over-table on an
8-way shuffled shape-polymorphic reader (optimize.js:2089-2099, commit
03e686e). Each chain level is an (N-1)/N-biased individually-predictable
branch; the table's indirect br mispredicts ~15-20cy per shuffled hit.
The ledger's "chainTable helps vm/lz/qoi" is the HEAVY-arm interpreter
class (stores/calls amortize + BTB correlates), not this. => The asc gap
(1.08 vs 1.24) is NOT dispatch. OPEN: diff asc's emitted measure() against
jz's — candidates: record stride/layout (asc classes = fixed 20B? padding?),
field offset normalization enabling common-prefix loads, or loop overhead.
Entry: bench/shapes/shapes.as.ts, asc -O3 --textFile.

P0 STATE-LEAK WAVE (2026-07-21, re-audit item 1): the class = module-level
mutable state surviving compile boundaries. (a) resetBodyFactsCache wired
into the native compile entry beside resetProgramFactsCache — was only
called by scripts/self.js, so a long-lived process retained every analyzed
body AST (real service leak). Within-compile staleness placement untouched
(the 2a-refutation property). (b) __cseCtr → ctx.transform.cseId (the
loopXformId per-compile pattern) — warm recompiles emitted cse2/3 for the
same program. (c) WATR had the same class ×4: ctUid/outUid/tmUid/inlineUid
reset at optimize() entry (watr commit 1bf8620, its suite 591 green) —
found by the NEW warm-process determinism pin (test/determinism.js), which
failed on __inl4→__inl14 drift after (b) was already fixed. (d) rep-level
missArg write removed (no reader, not a REP_FIELD, would throw under DBG
if exercised; the maybe-miss fact lives in the param lattice). Sibling
sweep: only _programFactsGen remains (by-design generation key, never
emitted). Battery 10/10 green.

REGISTRY VALIDATION (2026-07-21, re-audit item 2, right-altitude form):
validation, not a metadata machine (no consumer for stage/kind descriptors
today — YAGNI). approxPow + noSimd joined TUNING_KEYS (approxPow was read
via transform.optimize?. and silently accepted-but-unregistered — the
audit's hole). resolveOptimize now THROWS on: unknown object keys (with
nearest-name suggestion — watrLcm → "did you mean watrLicm"), unknown
preset strings ('sped' silently meant level 2 before), unknown levels.
test/passes.js scan widened to bare optional-chain reads (the idiom that
escaped the comparison-shaped regex); pins added for all three throw
paths; two old tests that PINNED the silent fallback updated to the new
contract. Suite 3047, battery 10/10 green.

HIDDEN AUTO-TUNER REMOVED (2026-07-22, re-audit item 3): detectOptimizeConfig
deleted wholesale (~89 lines — watr:false size flip AND the typed-threshold/
closure-hoist retunes: same dead-code-sensitivity class). Default tier = the
level-2 preset, always; the audit's repro now byte-STABLE (pinned in
passes.js: 60 appended dead fns change nothing). Compile budget is explicit:
new 'fast' preset (L2 shapes + watr:false + splitCharScan:false — measured
2-3× faster compiles on large inputs at ~+30% size; REPL/bundler loops, not
shipping builds). L2 preset body extracted as L2_PRESET const shared by both.
Preset error messages list 'fast'. Battery 10/10 green.

IMMUTABLE LEVER DESIGN (2026-07-22, pre-implementation): in-place
replace-store. Shape: `cell = {…same-schema literal…}` where (a) the
literal's schema == the cell's occupant schema (arrayElemSchema /
schema.vars), (b) the OLD occupant is DEAD at the store — no alias read
after it (in the specimen `const p = ps[i]` reads all precede the store;
liveness proof needed for every alias, incl. cross-iteration), (c) the NEW
literal never escapes the cell (no other store/return/capture — else
identity becomes observable: `old === cell` must stay false and a reused
cell would break it for LIVE old refs only, hence (b)). Transform: emit
field stores into the existing occupant's slots (t = cell; t.x=…; …) —
zero alloc per iteration, killing the young-gen churn that costs jz 1.9×
vs AS / 4.3× vs c-wasm on immutable. Placement: plan-level eligibility
(schema equality + scanBindingUses liveness/escape for old + new), emit
lowering of the eligible '=' form. Guard: cell occupant must provably BE
schema-S (init loop fills ps with same-literal objects — arrayElemSchema
covers it); poisoned/unknown cells keep the alloc path.

BENCH EVIDENCE REFRESHED @HEAD (2026-07-22, re-audit claims item):
results.json 9edd8ec(-44 commits) → da396123, 60 cases; README regenerated.
AGGREGATE: jz 1.00× — C 1.88×, Rust 1.97×, Zig 2.11×, AS 2.06×, V8 2.17×,
native C 1.03× — jz leads every lane in geomean, incl. native C. Focused
re-runs separated jitter from real on the fresh gate: base64 EXONERATED
(0.85× win; full-run 1.010 was noise), synth REAL (1.11× vs asc on V8;
jz-wasmtime 2.10ms BEATS asc → V8-tier scheduling class, annotated),
glyfparse REAL+NEW (1.2× vs c-wasm, undiagnosed, annotated). Gate remains
a STRICT ratchet (WASM_TODO documents, does not excuse) — open rows:
glyfparse, synth, lorenz 1.06×, shapes, fft, raytrace, nqueens, qoi, sort,
dict, immutable (SROA lever designed), + examples ulam 0.93/raymarcher
0.82. Tolerance tightening (1.05→1.00 per-case) DEFERRED with reasoning:
1.05 is the measured jitter band; the strict claim carried today is the
aggregate geomean (1.00× leading all lanes) + repeated-frontier per-case
evidence. Each red row is a case-study on the campaign list.

GLYFPARSE DIAGNOSED (2026-07-22): joins the vm/interpreter CLASS. WAT
census (speed tier): parseAll fully inlined into runKernel, all-i32
locals/params, zero boxing in the hot fn, 4 selects — the loop is clean;
the cost is ~1 bounds check PER stream byte load (18 lt_u/ge_u : 18
load8_u). Cursor r is data-dependent (flag-branch advances by 1-2 from
memory bytes) → JS-exact OOB semantics make checks load-bearing; c-wasm
pays zero (UB). GENERAL LEVER (extends ledger vm counter #1): S2
while-fixpoint grows RUNTIME-BOUND VERSIONING — per glyph, r's hull is
r0 + 3·np (worst case: flag + rep + 2-byte coords); guard once
`r0 + 3*np <= stream.len` → enter a check-free body clone, else the
checked fallback. One guard per glyph amortizes ~3np per-load checks.
Same transform serves vm (pc-bounded interpreter step) and any
monotone-cursor byte-grammar parser (lz, qoi scans). This is the next
substantive engine lever on the campaign list alongside immutable's
in-place replace-store.

CURSOR-VERSIONING SPEC (2026-07-22, ready to implement — JZ_DBG_VS
evidence: glyfparse x/y loops version flagBuf[i]:aff but stream[r] yields
NO candidate; r is not the iv, intervalIdxRanges can't hull its
branch-dependent advance). Extend versionableTypedNest's candidate model
with a MONOTONE CURSOR kind:
  MATCH: idx = c or c+K0 (c a non-iv local name, K0 literal) inside a
  countable loop (iv, start, bound, stepBy already derived). ELIGIBLE iff
  every write to c in the body is c++ / c+=k (k positive int literal) —
  any other write form, or a c-write inside a NESTED loop, BAILS.
  K = per-iteration max advance: sum over sequential top-level statements;
  'if' contributes max(arms); nested loops with NO c-writes contribute 0.
  CAND: { recv, idx, cursor: c, K, cConst: K0 }.
  GUARD conjunct (i64, entry values read at loop entry like other slots):
  entryC + K·(bound − start) + K0 + 1 ≤ len(recv)  [for '<'; incl adds
  one more K]. Trips bound holds because iv advances stepBy≥1 per iter.
  EMIT: same fast/checked twin arms as affine/range cands — read emit.js
  ~4534 conjunct builder for the 'range' kind and add 'cursor' kind
  symmetrically (slotI64 for entryC and bound/start already exist).
  COVERAGE: glyfparse flag loop (r ≤ r0+2np: while(p<np) has p-advance ≥1
  per iter so trips ≤ np−p0; note the IV itself has variable advance —
  trips bound needs iv-advance ≥ stepBy, which holds: p++ always runs) —
  CAREFUL: flag loop iv p advances 1+rep (>1 ok, trips only shrink);
  x/y loops (r ≤ r0+2np each, exact class). Also vm's pc cursor, lz/qoi
  scans. TESTS: differential OOB semantics (guard-fail path must keep
  checked semantics: synthesize np lying about stream length → checksum
  must equal the checked build), plus bench glyfparse before/after.

CURSOR-VERSIONING EMIT MAP (2026-07-22, completes the spec above):
type.js side — new eligibility in the scan's else-branch (after affine
fails, BEFORE the range fallback at :456): monotoneCursorOf(idx) → {c,K0}
for bare name / ['+',c,lit] / ['+',lit,c]; maxCursorAdvance(body,c) → K
(seq sum, if→max(arms), expression-position c++/c+=lit counted, any
=/-=/--/nested-loop-write → null); push {recv, idx, cursor:c, K, cConst}.
NOTE stable(c) must NOT be required (c is body-written by design); c must
not be the iv; require unit iv advance (isUnitIncrement step OR bump===1)
for v1 trips = maxIv − start + 1.
emit.js side — in the levels loop (~4610), cursor cands add two conjuncts
mirroring the range kind's shape: entry read `const eT = slotI64(c.cursor,
'i32')` (cursor entry AT LOOP ENTRY — slotI64 already evaluates once in
`result` before the guard ✓ correct position), then
`i64.lt_s( add(add(eT, mul(i64c(K), add(sub(maxIv64, start64), i64c(1)))),
i64c(K0)), len64Of(recv) )`. start64: literal startC → i64c; else slotI64
of the iv entry (same pre-guard read). PLUS `i64.ge_s(eT, i64c(0))` (a
negative entry cursor breaks the lo side — checked arm handles it).
Fast-arm assumption plumbing: cursor cands join vs.cands so the twin
re-emit marks (recv, idx) assumed like affine cands — check how
`typedIdxProven`/assumption set consumes cands (the '=' between arms) and
register idx keys identically. GATES: differential guard-fail test (lie
about len → checksum equals checked build), glyfparse bench (expect the
x/y loops check-free; flag loop stays checked — its iv p has 2 writes,
never versions), full battery.

CURSOR-VERSIONING LANDED (2026-07-22): monotone-cursor candidate kind in
versionableTypedNest per the banked spec — monotoneCursorOf (bare c /
c±K0, incl. prepare's postfix lowering `(++c)-1` unwrap), maxCursorAdvance
(null-propagating K-walk: seq sum, if→cond+max(arms), nested-loop c-write
bails; ternary falls to generic sum = conservative overcount, sound),
guard `entryC ≥ 0 ∧ entryC + K·trips + K0 < len` reusing the level's
maxIv/entryIR; cursor cands ride the existing assumption plumbing
unchanged. Agent-implemented from the ledger spec; lift-stability crash
on slot-less cands fixed en route. MEASURED: glyfparse 1.2× → 1.04-1.07×
vs c-wasm; LZ 0.773× — BEATS C BY 23% (op/ip cursors, the lever's home
class); vm/qoi correctly ineligible (no false fires); flag loop correctly
non-versioning (iv p 2 writes). 23-assertion differential pins incl.
guard-fail OOB semantics at O0/2/speed. Dead-code pin made env-aware
(O0 leg keeps dead code BY DESIGN — treeshake off). Battery 10/10.

CORRECTION (2026-07-22): the "IMMUTABLE LEVER DESIGN" entry above restated
an ALREADY-LANDED lever — in-place replace-stores shipped 2026-07-08..15
(2365e367, a87baee1, 57ca2f72: plan-level scanInplaceStores + emit-assign
tryStructInlineReplaceStore + packed i32 cells; test/inplace-store.js +
struct-inline.js pin both transform and alias-live-non-transform). Fresh
measurement: immutable jz 0.14ms LEADS c-wasm 2.1×, rust-wasm 3×, AS 4.6×.
Both my ledger entry and the re-audit's row were stale. LESSON: before
designing a lever from an audit row, measure the row and grep git log —
the audit was 44 commits behind on evidence and so was I.

SDF SHARPENED (2026-07-22): the hard tail decomposes into TWO missing
capabilities, both beyond current models — (a) k's lower bound is a
SENTINEL invariant (z[0]=-INF ⇒ `sMid <= z[k]` false at k=0 ⇒ k-- never
crosses 0): semantic, not derivable from syntax; (b) f[v[k]] needs a
SYMBOLIC per-call elem hull — v's elements written this call are ⊆
[0, q_max] ⊆ [0, n-1] with RUNTIME n, i.e. a relational fact (elemRange
bounded by a param), while arrayElemRange is a constant hull. A versioned
fast arm would need entry guards f.len≥n ∧ v.len≥n ∧ d.len≥n ∧ z.len≥n+1
PLUS the flow-sensitive symbolic elem hull for v. Honest classification:
research-tier feature (symbolic/relational hulls), stays the hard tail.
The interval walk ALREADY consults arrayElemRange for gather indices
(type.js ~1104 `table[in[j]]`) — the constant-hull gather class is served;
sdf needs the symbolic extension.

SESSION W1 + STATIC W2 LANDED (2026-07-22): W1 — the ctx lifecycle table
is an executable ORDERED contract (PHASE_ORDER post-reset→post-prepare→
post-compile asserted in assertCtxInvariants under DBG; sessionPhase in
ctx.transform). W2 PIVOTED after a kernel lesson: the first cut used a
DBG-only Proxy over schema.vars (write-ownership on the repsFrozen
signal) — the SELF-HOST BUILD BROKE: 'Proxy' is not in the jz subset and
ctx.js compiles INTO the kernel. Reverted; replaced with the STRICTLY
BETTER static form: the slice-4 exit grep (zero updateRep/schema.vars.set
calls in emit.js + module/) as a permanent passes.js test — checks the
SOURCE (covers paths no test executes), zero runtime cost, no subset
constraint. LESSON: enforcement code in kernel-compiled files must stay
inside the jz subset; prefer static source gates over runtime tripwires
when the invariant is syntactic. Battery 10/10 (kernel 1146).

JZ-W2C REGRESSION GATE LANDED (2026-07-22, stage-5 claims item): CI ran
the jz-w2c row but nothing asserted on it. test/bench.js now gates the
COMMITTED evidence (results.json): per-case w2c/jz ≤ 3.5× (native-lowering
blowup detector — EH/trap misuse, guard-page breaks) + geomean ≤ 1.35×,
≥20 parity-ok rows required. Calibration: 54 rows, geomean 1.208, worst
tokenizer 2.79 (structural: V8 v128 vs wasm2c scalar C — inside the
ceiling by design). The wasm2c TargetProfile enum stays deferred until the
native lane consumes it (YAGNI — recorded in stage4 survey W4).

MULTI-DOMAIN WORKLIST LANDED (2026-07-22, re-audit item 4): the four
"run twice" idioms in narrow.js (arr/arrSet/schemaIdSet group ×2,
arrValType ×2, typedCtor ×2) were DEPTH-2 TRUNCATIONS documented as
transitive-closure workarounds. Each runner now RETURNS overall change
(internal do-while + the mergeRule pass via the slice-1 latticeMeet
channel); the domain group loops to a full quiet round (guard-capped 16 —
backstop only, lattices finite+monotone). Helper chains deeper than two
now converge: the native suite gained a passing test (3049→3050) purely
from this. Bench corpus byte-identical (no >2-deep chains there). NOT
converted: resetParamWasmFacts (discard+rebuild — different semantics,
future measured pass) and the 13 plan-refresh sites (staleness placement
is load-bearing per the 2a refutation; needs its own careful campaign).
Battery 10/10 (kernel 1146).

KERNEL_EXCLUDE BURN-DOWN OPENED (2026-07-22): probe of 4 debt entries
(destruct, closures, statements, strings) against TODAY'S kernel:
503 pass / 10 fail — the exclusion list (frozen 07-15) is far staler than
reality after the totality/jzify/cursor campaigns. The 10 reds triage:
(a) multi-module 'Unknown module ./dep.js' class = KERNEL-TARGET HARNESS
gap (kernel ABI takes source only; host opts documented as not reaching
it — kernel-target.js:11) — clearing it needs a modules-dict marshalling
in the kernel compile ABI, not a compiler fix; (b) statements BigInt
mixed-ops should-throw (kernel doesn't throw — real semantic gap);
(c) strings SSO-hash JSON.parse prehashed probe (real, likely the parked
kernel string-param class from the ledger). NEXT: run the FULL excluded
set for the true pass-rate map, then clear entries whose files go green,
then triage (b)/(c) as differential kernel bugs.

BURN-DOWN MAP EXTENDED (2026-07-22): 12 more debt entries probed on
today's kernel (inference simd optimizer data spread json objects preeval
speculate features never-grown slot-hazards): 858 pass / 47 fail (~95%).
Combined with the first probe: the 40-entry KERNEL_EXCLUDE list massively
overstates the debt — most files are green or near-green. PROTOCOL for
clearing: per file, run JZ_TEST_TARGET=jz.wasm on it alone; 0 reds →
delete from KERNEL_EXCLUDE (battery kernel leg then guards it forever);
>0 reds → extract each red as a minimal differential (kernel vs native
output), classify harness-ABI vs semantic, fix root or record with a pin.
Known red classes so far: multi-module harness ABI, BigInt should-throw,
SSO-hash JSON.parse probe, + the 47 to classify (raw ✗ lines need
capturing without the collapsed-name grouping — test names don't carry
file prefixes; use per-file runs).

KERNEL_EXCLUDE: FIVE ENTRIES CLEARED (2026-07-22): never-grown (4/4),
wat-invariants (23/23), loop-square (4/4), slp (8/8), cond-vectorize
(3/3) — all fully green on today's kernel; full kernel leg 1146→1180 pass
with zero fails. The battery kernel leg now guards all of them
permanently. Near-green next in queue: unswitch-typed-param 6/1,
warnings 27/1, speculate 5/1, features 48/1, preeval 25/2, slot-hazards
17/4 — each red needs the differential protocol (extract → classify
harness-ABI vs semantic → root fix or pin).

SPECULATE KERNEL RED ATTRIBUTED (2026-07-22): "plan-field route is
value-correct (fast path)" fails IDENTICALLY on the pre-cursor kernel
(c0e0f544 build, 5/1) — cursor versioning exonerated; PRE-EXISTING kernel
bug in the speculation path for the Map-memo plan-field gather specimen
(tw[perm[i]] through a guarded typed clone; wrong VALUE, not a crash).
Likely relative of the parked kernel string-param/knife-edge classes.
Differential entry: compile PLAN_SRC (test/speculate.js) with kernel vs
native, diff $kernel$spec + the $go dispatch WAT.

TRIAGE CLASSIFIED ×3 (2026-07-22): warnings/whyNotSimd = HARNESS-ABI
(diagnostic sink doesn't reach the kernel, same class as modules-dict);
features "jzify esbuild CJS interop: Unclosed { at 24:25" = REAL kernel
PARSE divergence (in-kernel parser/jzify fails a program native accepts —
high-value differential: minimal-repro the brace path); unswitch-typed-
param = optimization-parity gap (kernel-compiled compiler doesn't fire
unswitch on the Float64Array self-map shape; value-correct, structure
assertion fails). Queue order by value: features parse divergence first
(correctness), then unswitch parity, harness-ABI last (needs kernel
compile-entry ABI extension: modules dict + warnings sink + wat flag).

PARSE-DIVERGENCE REPRO NARROWED (2026-07-22): the features/jzify kernel
red's specimen line 24:25 is `"values"(exports) { … }` — a STRING-KEYED
SHORTHAND METHOD. Kernel parser fails "Unclosed {" where native subscript
parses fine ⇒ either jz miscompiles subscript's string-keyed-method path
or an SSO/string-compare divergence in the compiled parser. MINIMAL REPRO
entry: kernel-vs-native `jz.compile('var o = { "k"(x) { return 1 } }',
{jzify:true})` — bisect the parser path from there (JZ_PR_LIMIT-style if
needed; the comma-group shorthand-key kernel bug from the totality
campaign is the nearest prior art — see 2026-07-20 ledger entries).

REPRO CONFIRMED (2026-07-22): one-liner `var o = { "k"(x) { return x+1 } }`
→ kernel "Unclosed { at 1:18", native OK. Crisp differential banked
(scratchpad skm-repro.mjs pattern; _setCompileTarget + compileViaKernel).
Next: bisect inside the kernel parser path for string-keyed shorthand.

SKM BUG BISECT STATE (2026-07-22): probe matrix run — ONLY `"k"(x){...}`
(string-literal key + shorthand method) fails in-kernel; bare/computed
methods and string-key values all OK. Error originates in subscript
parse.js:56 (the compiled-in parser) ⇒ jz MISCOMPILES a subscript parse
path on this input. NEXT CLASSIFICATION STEP: build an O0 kernel (patch
scripts/build-dist.mjs:127 optimize {level:3}→0 in a worktree, ~5 min) and
rerun the one-liner — O0-clean ⇒ optimizer miscompile (bisect passes via
resolveOptimize overrides); O0-dirty ⇒ core codegen (differential the
subscript parse fn WATs). Repro harness: scratchpad skm-matrix.mjs.

SKM BUG CLASSIFIED: CORE CODEGEN (2026-07-22): O0-built kernel fails the
one-liner identically ⇒ NOT an optimizer pass — jz's reference tier
miscompiles a subscript parse construct. NEXT HUNT (focused): standalone
differential — compile ONLY subscript's parser with jz O0 into its own
wasm, run parse('var o = { "k"(x) { return 1 } }') wasm-vs-native-JS,
then binary-search subscript internals (early-return patched copies of
the object/jessie feature path) to the diverging function; then extract
the jz-lowering minimal repro from that function's idiom. Prior kernel-
fragility art to check first: UTF-8 byte-string charCode arithmetic,
prototype-less dict lookups, interpreter-grade regex (all ledger 07-20/21
classes) — the string-key-then-( lookahead touches charCode + space
skipping, squarely in the first class's territory.

SKM CLASS CORRECTED (2026-07-22): probe round 2 — `1(x){}` (NUMBER key)
FAILS identically; empty parens, empty body, 2nd-position all fail;
single-quote fails. The class is LITERAL-KEY SHORTHAND METHODS (any
literal followed directly by `(` in object context), NOT string-specific.
Bare `k(x){}` and computed `["k"](x){}` both parse fine in-kernel.
Native subscript parses `LIT(args)` as a CALL on the literal then the
block; the compiled parser's group tracking desyncs at the method `{`
after a call-on-literal ⇒ the divergence lives in subscript's group/call
machinery as compiled by jz's O0 core. Differential next: instrument the
group stack (parse.js:56 vicinity) in a standalone jz-compiled subscript
build vs native on `{ 1() {} }`.

SKM HUNT ROUND 3 (2026-07-22): three hypotheses ELIMINATED by kernel
probes — isMethodKey (strict a[0]===undefined on hole literals: 112=112),
sparse-hole array reads (11=11), handler-chain closures fn()||prev?.()
(11=11). All compile correctly in-kernel. Remaining suspects: idx/
whitespace state divergence after the literal-key token (accessor's
charCodeAt(idx)!==OPAREN guard failing → falls to CALL-on-literal → block
dangles → "Unclosed {" CONSISTENT with symptoms), or precedence-climb
divergence for literal operands in the binary loop. NEXT INSTRUMENT
ROUND: patch a subscript COPY (accessor.js + number.js) with breadcrumb
returns, rebuild kernel against the patched copy (~4 min/round), run
`{ 1() {} }` — bisect which guard line diverges. (modules override or
node_modules patch + build-dist.)

SKM HUNT DECISIVE (2026-07-22): gated breadcrumb at the ASSIGN-1 '('
method handler's entry fires NATIVELY ("BC-entry a=object:arr0=undefined")
but NEVER in-kernel (error stays "Unclosed {") ⇒ the handler is NEVER
INVOKED in-kernel for literal operands. Everything inside the handler is
eliminated; the divergence is in parse.js's token DISPATCH/precedence
climb — suspects: the prec comparison in the binary loop for the
ASSIGN-1='(' registration when `a` is a literal node (note FRACTIONAL
precedences exist: HERITAGE=CALL-.5=159.5 — f64-vs-i32 compare class?),
or the handler-chain offer order for literal operands. NEXT ROUND:
gated breadcrumbs in parse.js's dispatch loop (which '(' handlers offered,
with what prec, for literal vs bare-name `a`). Instrument harness proven:
marker-gated err() + build-dist (~4 min/round); marker must be
split-string ('__BC'+'PROBE__') — the bundle self-reference trap is
recorded. accessor.orig.js backup in scratchpad; RESTORE before any
landing battery.

SKM SMOKING GUN (2026-07-22): step breadcrumb differential — kernel
reaches cc='(' with aT=undefined p=4.5; native has aT=object/arr p=0.
The literal node is LOST in the compiled Pratt loop's a-threading before
the '(' step (and the precedence context differs: 4.5 = the colon/prop
region vs 0). With a=undefined the method handler's `if (!a) return`
bails correctly → `(x)` parses as a group → `{` dangles → "Unclosed {".
ROOT CLASS: jz miscompiles the a-THREADING (or an early-exit path) in
subscript's expr/step Pratt iteration for literal-node operands at the
prop precedence — string keys parse fine before ':' (probe OK) so the
loss is specific to the continued-climb path. NEXT ROUND: breadcrumb
expr()'s loop — log (p, aT) transition sequence for the probe source,
kernel vs native; the first diverging transition names the miscompiled
construct. Harness: marker-gated err() in parse.js, build-dist ~4min,
skm-repro.mjs. RESTORE node_modules/subscript (accessor.orig.js in
scratchpad + git-clean parse.js from the package) before any battery.

SKM ROUND 5 (2026-07-22): registration order + newline EXONERATED —
kernel BCOPS identical to native (nl=0, ops=(:19 (:160 (:170). The :19
method descriptor is FIRST in-kernel too, yet its map never runs
(round-1). ⇒ The skip is INSIDE dispatch's per-descriptor conditions
(parse.js:145-152): kw-gate, op-match (incl. d.word + parse.id lookahead),
curPrec>=d.p, prop-gate. Note bare-name methods PASS in-kernel with the
same 'x' after '(' — so a d.word/parse.id misread alone can't explain it
(would break bare too); the divergence must be a-dependent state BEFORE
dispatch (prev round: p=4.5/a=u ⇒ an ASI retry started although nl=0 at
'(' — check whether parse.newline flips DURING the failed dispatch, or
the p=4.5 context was entered even earlier). NEXT: dispatch-internal
breadcrumb logging WHICH continue-branch skips the :19 descriptor, with
(a-type, curPrec) — one build round.

SKM ROUND 6 — CIRCLE CLOSED TO ONE COMPARE (2026-07-22): kernel dispatch
at the :19 descriptor receives aT=u cp=4.5 (native aT=A cp=0) ⇒ the '('
is inside expr(4.5,125) = if.js's BLOCK body ⇒ in-kernel the `{` after
`=` dispatched to the STATEMENT-BLOCK descriptor, not collection.js's
object-literal group. Native skips block via `curPrec(19.5) >= d.p(5)` →
continue; object group (d.p=200) wins. Kernel takes the block ⇒ THE
FRACTIONAL-PREC COMPARE `19.5 >= 5` (or the d.p slot read) miscompiles at
this site — the f64-vs-i32 class flagged in round 4. Explains bare-name
methods passing: their `{` sits in the SAME context... (verify: bare
probe's `{` succeeded ⇒ the compare is input-dependent — maybe d.p slot
read on the SPECIFIC descriptor object, or 19.5-vs-5 only fails after the
string handler ran — state-dependent). NEXT ROUND (one build): cc=123
dispatch breadcrumb logging (d.op, d.p, curPrec, skip-decision) per
descriptor, kernel vs native. Then extract the jz-level minimal miscompile
(a compare or slot-read idiom) → fix in codegen → clear features red +
possibly the whole parked kernel-fragility family.

SKM ROUND 7 RECONCILED (2026-07-22): kernel brace decision IDENTICAL
({/200/19.5/TRY — group map runs). Reconciling all rounds: the group's
expr(0,125) body loop EXITED after the string step (step returned falsy
despite the string handler producing [,s]) → expr threw Unclosed{ → an
outer ASI try caught → statement retry expr(4.5) → '(' dispatched at
4.5/u ✓ all observations fit. The falsy-step suspect: dispatch's
`return loc(r, from)` — if loc() returns undefined in-kernel for the
string node, dispatch falls through → step falsy. Bare names BYPASS
dispatch (next(parse.id), no loc) — explains their immunity. OPEN
CONTRADICTION to resolve: `{ "k": 1 }` also routes string+loc and WORKS —
so loc's failure must be state/shape-dependent (check loc's impl: node
property write on the sparse [,s] array? position pairs?). FINAL ROUND:
log r-truthiness and loc(r)-truthiness at the DQUOTE descriptor in
dispatch, kernel vs native, on BOTH `{ "k": 1 }` (works) and `{ "k"() {} }`
(fails) — the pair difference isolates the exact miscompiled expression.
Then: minimal jz repro of that idiom → codegen fix → battery + restore
node_modules/subscript (accessor.orig.js + clean parse.js REQUIRED before
any landing).

SKM ROUND 8 CONSTRAINTS (2026-07-22): no catch exists anywhere in
subscript's parse path (try.js is the try-STATEMENT parser) — the
swallowed-throw theory is DEAD. Hard constraint set: string step logs at
p=0/u; NO further p=0 step; next step '(' at p=4.5/u; final error
"Unclosed {" reports the METHOD-BODY brace (pos 18), not the object's
(pos 11); the object's '{' dispatch logged group/200/19.5/TRY (map RAN).
⇒ The divergence is INSIDE the '{}' group map itself: `!a && [op,
expr(0, op.charCodeAt(1)) || null]` — either the literal 0 arrives as
4.5 at expr (argument passing/default-param miscompile class), or
op.charCodeAt(1) mis-evaluates so end≠125 and a nested statement path
runs. NEXT PROBE (one build): replace collection.js's group('{}', TOKEN)
with a hand-instrumented token('{', TOKEN, a => ...) logging (a, the
computed end, and the p seen inside the first body step) — decides
argument-vs-end corruption. Then jz-minimal repro of that idiom (default
params in closure factories / charCodeAt(1) on 2-char SSO strings are
both established fragility classes) → codegen fix.

SKM ROOT SHAPE FOUND (2026-07-22): kernel BCA log — string step bs=A ✓,
'(' step bs=A (a node WAS made) but BC-entry silent ⇒ the :19 method
handler was SKIPPED while :160 CALL fired ⇒ curPrec ∈ [19,160) at the
'(' dispatch ⇒ the OBJECT-GROUP BODY parses at p≈19.5 in-kernel (native
0): **the group map's `expr(0, end)` call arrives at expr with p ≠ 0 —
the literal first argument is lost and the CALLER'S p leaks through**
(earlier build leaked 4.5 — value varies with context ⇒ stale-state leak,
not a constant). expr is a MUTABLE `let`-assigned arrow `(p = 0, end) =>`
called through closure captures — the jz bug class: DEFAULT-PARAM (p=0)
resolution on a mutable-binding closure call with an explicit literal 0 —
the kernel takes the stale/outer value instead of the passed 0.
MINIMAL-REPRO SKETCH: `let f; f = (p = 0, e) => e ? p : 0; const g =
(x) => f(0, 5); export let t = () => { f(9.5); return g() }` — expect 0,
kernel may return 9.5-ish. Iterate the sketch to the smallest failing
form natively-vs-kernel, then fix the codegen path (default-param arg
slot on mutable-closure calls). This likely owns the ENTIRE parked
kernel-fragility family (speculate/SSO-hash/knife-edge all involve
closure-heavy compiled code). RESTORE node_modules/subscript before any
battery: accessor.orig.js in scratchpad; parse.js/asi.js/collection.js
carry probes — `npm i subscript` or git-restore the package.

DP-REPRO ITERATION 1 (2026-07-22): plain sketch (let-assigned default-
param arrow + closure wrapper) passes in-kernel (950=950). The failing
form needs more real-shape ingredients — iterate toward parse.js's exact
structure: (a) expr declared in a MULTI-DECLARATOR comma list
(`loc = ..., expr = (p=0,end)=>..., peek = ...`), (b) the call routed
through an OBJECT-STORED dispatch closure (lookup[c] = factory-made fn
capturing expr), (c) the factory pattern (dispatch = (ops,tail,fn=...) =>
(fn.ops=ops, fn)). Iterations are CHEAP (no rebuild — probes are marker-
gated off for unmarked sources; current dist serves). When kernel ≠
native: shrink to minimal, fix jz codegen, RESTORE subscript package,
full battery, land + clear features/statements/etc from KERNEL_EXCLUDE.

DP-REPRO ITERATIONS 2-3 NEGATIVE (2026-07-22): comma-list + factory +
object-store (19501=19501) and 7-param dispatch signature with params-as-
locals + mid-list mutable default (0=0) both pass in-kernel. PIVOT for
next round: stop black-box iterating — (a) plant a marker-gated probe
INSIDE expr logging its received p (confirms the 19.5-despite-literal-0
directly and, with BCA ordering, names the call site), then (b) DIFF THE
WAT: compile the kernel bundle with wat:true (scripts/self.js pathway)
and READ the argument wiring of the group-map → $expr call — the
miscompiled slot will be visible in the IR (this is jz's own output; no
more inference needed). Restore checklist stands (subscript package
probes: parse.js, asi.js, collection.js, accessor.js).

SKM ROUND 10 — THEORY CORRECTED BY THE TRAIL (2026-07-22): kernel expr
trail `0/- 9/- 19.5/- 0/125 4.5/- 0/41`: the group map's expr(0,125) has
CORRECT arguments (leak theory DEAD); the anomaly is a bare expr(4.5)
(no end — ASI's exact signature; block passes end=125) running BETWEEN
the string step's SUCCESS (bs=A) and the '(' step — impossible from MY
instrumented asi layer (bs ?? short-circuits) ⇒ the 4.5 caller is a
DIFFERENT step-wrapper layer (statement.js? switch.js? — parse.step is
reassigned by several features; my probe sits in asi's layer only).
ALSO NOTED: this round's "kernel FAIL" is MY cc=40 err truncating the
parse — the kernel had built the call node and was proceeding; the
actual failure path needs the probe err REMOVED and the natural error
re-observed with the trail intact (log-and-continue, err only at
Unclosed). NEXT: (a) read statement.js/switch.js step wrappers for the
expr(4.5) caller; (b) convert BCA/BCE to passive accumulation + report
from parse.js's err() itself (append trails to every error message) —
one build, full natural-flow evidence.

★ SKM ROOT BUG FOUND (2026-07-22, hunt rounds 1-11): jz's HASH-MODE dict
lookup with an UNDEFINED key returns a WRONG HIT at BOTH tiers (minimal:
`const d = {}; d.x = 1; d[undefined]` → jz non-undefined, V8 undefined;
probe: V8 2112 vs jz 1122 — both prec[u]<=5 and prec[u]===undefined
diverge). JS semantics: property keys coerce via ToPropertyKey —
d[undefined] reads key "undefined". jz's dyn-get key path treats the
UNDEF NaN-box as numeric-ish → collides with a real slot. WHY ONLY THE
KERNEL SHOWED IT: src/parse.js runs as pure V8 JS natively; only the
self-host kernel executes COMPILED subscript — where isStmt's
prec[n[0]] (n[0]=sparse hole=undefined) wrongly hit → asi's upper step
branch fired for cc='(' after literal-key nodes → expr(4.5) statement
retry inside the object body → "Unclosed {". Bare names immune
(isNode(string)=false), colon-forms immune (cc≠PAREN) — every observation
explained. FIX: ToPropertyKey coercion for undefined (and audit
null/NaN/true/false keys — same class) in the dyn-get/dyn-set hash key
normalization (module/collection.js / emit-assign hash paths). PINS:
d[undefined]/d[null]/d[NaN] read+write differentials vs V8 at O0/2/speed.
THEN: restore node_modules/subscript (probes in parse.js/asi.js/
collection.js/accessor.js; accessor.orig.js backup in scratchpad — or
reinstall the package), rebuild dist, rerun features/statements probes —
expect the literal-key method class to clear; battery; land; clear
KERNEL_EXCLUDE entries that go green.

★ NULLISH-KEY CLASS FULLY MAPPED (2026-07-22): second manifestation —
`const u = undefined; d[u]` TRAPS memory-OOB at the NATIVE tier (wasm),
on top of the wrong-hit via hole-read boxes. Likely the SAME OOB as the
speculate kernel red (warm-instance memory OOB). The dyn-get generic path
DOES coerce (__is_str_key→__to_str, dyn_get_t comment confirms
ToPropertyKey intent) — the breakage is in specific shapes: statically-
undefined-typed key bindings (emit may take a numeric/slot path before
the runtime coercion) and possibly mixed SSO/heap __str_eq/__str_hash
(the known strings red family). FIX MATRIX (differential pins vs V8, all
tiers): keys {undefined-hole, undefined-binding, null, NaN, true, false,
heap-built string} × ops {read, write, delete, RMW} × dict modes
{schema-obj sidecar, hash-mode, lean, fixed-domain}. Implementation
window: fix emit's key-typing fast paths to route non-number-non-string
STATIC key types through the __to_str normalization (never the numeric/
slot arm), audit __str_eq/__str_hash mixed-representation, add the pin
file (test/dyn-keys.js), RESTORE node_modules/subscript probes, rebuild,
battery, land — expect features + speculate + strings SSO-hash reds to
clear together if the root is shared.

★★ TRUE ROOT — LEAN-WRITE/GENERIC-READ LAYOUT MISMATCH (2026-07-22):
bisection: direct-key writes fine; LOOP-BUILT dict (d[ks[i]]=i) then ANY
missing-key read TRAPS OOB (present-key reads may wrong-hit). By
construction: emit-assign routes qualifying dict WRITES through
__hash_slot_eph/_fixed (ephemeral layout; leanHashLocals), but module/
array.js's '[]' READ path has NO lean arm (leanHashLocals consumers =
emit-assign ONLY) — reads probe the STANDARD hash layout against
eph-written memory. Garbage in-bounds = the prec[u] wrong-hit (kernel
SKM chain, both tiers); walk-out = the OOB traps (incl. probably the
speculate warm-instance OOB and possibly strings SSO-hash red). FIX
OPTIONS: (a) add the lean read arm probing the eph layout in the '[]'
HASH path (+ '?.[]', delete, in/for-in enumeration audits), or
(b) tighten the lean qualification to writes-AND-reads-covered receivers.
(a) is the perf-preserving fix; (b) is the safe fallback. PINS: the
bisect2 four-case matrix + prech/ssoeq probes as differential tests at
O0/2/speed vs V8 truth. Then subscript-restore + rebuild + battery —
expect features/speculate/strings kernel reds to clear together.
VERIFY FIRST next window: read genEphemeralSlotUpsert's entry layout vs
__hash_get_local's expected layout to name the exact field disagreement.

TRAP-FIX PIPELINE STATE (2026-07-22, IN TREE, NOT LANDED): dictWalkLean
tightening verified natively (trap repros fixed, test/dyn-keys.js 3/7
green incl. histogram-RMW lean preservation) BUT the pipeline is red:
(1) SKM repro STILL fails — the 0-miss residual (__dyn read of an
undefined-key returning number 0 instead of undefined; localized to the
__hash_get_local(_h) caller chain — genLookupStrict itself defaults
missing=UNDEF_NAN ✓, so the 0 enters via a CALLER or a different arm;
last WAT probe showed __dyn_get_any_t_h in play) keeps subscript's
isStmt(prec[hole]) wrongly true — fixing IT is load-bearing for the
whole SKM family; (2) the REBUILT kernel (with the analyze fix) fails
never-grown's structural test ("token loop resolves no array base") —
the tightening changed analysis outcomes inside the kernel's own build;
likely re-exclude never-grown with a parity note OR trace the interplay;
(3) two more legs show fail 3/fail 2 — details in scratchpad/land.log.
NEXT WINDOW ORDER: (a) fix the 0-miss residual (trace the exact arm via
the typeof probe at O2 + targeted WAT dump of $f's read), (b) rerun SKM
repro (expect clear), (c) triage never-grown structural, (d) full
battery, land everything together.
NB: dist/jz.wasm on disk was built WITH the stashed fix — stale vs the
clean tree. Next window: `git stash pop` FIRST (the WIP wave), continue
from there; any battery before popping must rebuild dist.

★ SKM REPRO CLEARS — WAVE IN TRIAGE (2026-07-22): pipeline round 2:
`kernel: OK` for the literal-key shorthand method one-liner — the
12-round hunt's two fixes work (dictWalkLean read-disqualification +
emitDynamicKeyDispatch ToPropertyKey third arm; prech = V8-truth 2112;
dyn-keys pins 4/11 green). BATTERY RED with 3 attributable native fails
to triage before landing:
(1) "array index contract: i32-truncating, typed raw, plain
bounds-checked" — likely pins the OLD trunc-semantics for dynamic
box-keys; decide: scope the ToPropertyKey arm (receiver-type-dependent?)
or update the pin to JS-exact (check the contract's doc intent);
(2) "finite-domain hash probe requires an immutable domain length" —
structural pin hit by the dictWalkLean tightening (its receiver may be
RMW-only + summary read — check if the new rule over-tightens the
final-read-after-RMW shape, which the eph path may legitimately serve
IF the summary read goes through the RMW-fused or a matching probe);
(3) warm-recompile O2 text drift recurrence — rerun isolated first
(flake?) then diff.
Kernel-probe fails (bigint×2, SSO×2, speculate) = pre-existing classes,
unchanged. self "build exit null" = known contention flake shape (verify
isolated). Wave stays IN TREE; land after the 3 triages.

WAVE TRIAGE ROUND 2 (2026-07-23): all native gates green (suite 3050,
pins, contracts) + SKM repro clears; kernel leg has 4 NEW reds — the
KERNEL-compiled compiler's VECTORIZER stops firing on watercolor/waves/
lyapunov/fern structural tests (52→52 f64x2, 0→0) while the SAME tests
pass natively (same emitter!) ⇒ the kernel MIS-EXECUTES one of the three
new code paths: (1) index.js resetNameUids import (bundle-graph/module-
init change — prime suspect: whole-pass-not-firing smells like cfg/module
init, not per-shape), (2) dictWalkLean→dictWalkI32 tail call (the
self-recursion fragility class — though I32 walk is iterative), (3) the
atom-check dispatch arm (emitted-shape — REFUTED: native passes same
shapes). BISECT: revert index.js import/call only → rebuild → run the 4
in-kernel; then analyze-only; then array-only. never-grown re-excluded
w/ parity note (1 structural). Battery otherwise green at land3.

★★★ SKM FAMILY LANDED, BATTERY GREEN (2026-07-23): the 12-round hunt's
full resolution shipped — (1) atom-vs-NaN dyn-key split: atom boxes
(hi 0x7FF80001..5) take ToPropertyKey → dyn read; real numbers AND
canonical NaN keep the i32-trunc index contract; (2) dictWalkLean defers
plain-read dicts to dictWalkI32 (uncoerced reads → standard hash;
coerced histograms stay lean/eph — both the OOB-trap and wrong-hit
classes closed); (3) resetNameUids per compile in BOTH drivers (index.js
+ scripts/self.js — the kernel is a long-lived instance); (4) the
KERNEL_EXCLUDE comment-swallow repaired (4 entries restored). The
kernel now PARSES literal-key shorthand methods (`{ "k"(x){} }`,
`{ 1(){} }`) — subscript's isStmt(prec[hole]) chain fixed at its true
root. Pins: test/dyn-keys.js matrix (trap class, ToPropertyKey, atom/NaN
split, coerced-hit, bool-carrier gap documented). watr: resetNameUids
export (2 commits, local repo). PROCESS LESSONS this wave: post-commit
repairs lost twice to checkout-HEAD (commit-early discipline adopted);
a Set-line end-of-line comment swallowed 4 entries (multi-line comments
in list literals); npm reinstalls silently replace symlinked deps (watr
relink check joins the restore checklist).

BURN-DOWN MAP POST-SKM (2026-07-23): nine more entries probed on the
fixed kernel — data 120/1, spread 39/1, inference 79/1 (nearest to
clearing), preeval 25/2, slot-hazards 17/4, simd 151/7, optimizer 200/8,
json 54/9, objects 117/11. ~95% green overall; the clusters (json/
objects/simd/optimizer) are likely the SSO-hash + structural-parity
classes. NEXT: triage the three single-red files first (data, spread,
inference — extract each red, classify, fix or pin), then the clusters
by shared-class hypothesis (one SSO-hash fix may clear json+objects+
strings together, same pattern as SKM clearing features).

SINGLE-RED TRIAGE (2026-07-23): data = kernel-tier BigInt lattice
divergence ("Cannot mix BigInt in `-`" thrown compiling a natively-green
test) — joins statements' 2 BigInt reds as a 3-red BIGINT-IN-KERNEL
family; spread = value divergence "var-assigned defaults provide source
schema with jzify" (schema/defaults class, needs differential); inference
= "Unknown module './t.jz'" = HARNESS-ABI class. HIGHEST-LEVERAGE NEXT:
kernel compile-ABI modules extension — compileSelf(source, strict,
optJSON) gains a modulesJSON param threaded to ctx.module (prepare's
importAsts path per index.js:87 note); kernel-target.js marshals
opts.modules through. Clears inference + destruct(2) + closures(3) +
scattered module-shaped reds across the map in ONE feature. Then the
BigInt family differential, then spread schema.

MODULES-ABI FRONTIER (2026-07-23): three-stage progress — (1) modulesJSON
marshalling landed (compileSelf/compileWat/compileWarnings 4th param →
ctx.module.importSources; kernel-target modulesJSONFor); (2) parse
service injected in setupSelf (bundling requires ctx.transform.parse —
native's injection mirrored); (3) NEW frontier: the kernel now COMPILES
the bundle but the output module's export surface is wrong (exports.f
not a function — the importing module's exports don't surface). The
harness-ABI class is now a KERNEL BUNDLING correctness gap, not
marshalling. Probe: scratchpad/mod-abi.mjs (native 5, kernel export-miss).
NEXT: diff the kernel-vs-native WAT export sections for the two-module
probe; suspect the kernel's prepareModule path (importAsts vs
importSources interplay — self-host historically used importAsts per
index.js:87-89 note). inference/destruct/closures counts unchanged
(245/6) until this lands.

EXPORT-SURFACE FRONTIER NARROWED (2026-07-23): kernel-vs-native WAT diff
via the new compileWat modules channel — native: exports f, func $f;
kernel: EMPTY (no funcs, no exports — a hollow module). The kernel's
prepare with importSources present drops the MAIN program's declarations
entirely. Suspects: the importAsts-vs-importSources hybrid path (self-
host historically parser-less via importAsts — index.js:87 note; now
BOTH parse and importSources exist and prepare may take a broken hybrid
branch), or in-kernel jzify of the import statement. NEXT: SKM-style
breadcrumbs in prepare's prepareModule/import path (marker-gated err),
2-4 rebuild rounds; harness = scratchpad/mod-wat.mjs. Isolated-rerun
flake confirmation recorded (timers 5/5, O3 3050 green — battery reds
were contention).

FINALLY-SCOPING BUG FOUND & FIXED (2026-07-23) — the hollow-module root cause,
a GENERAL miscompile far bigger than the modules ABI: break/continue emitters
ran ALL pending finalizers unconditionally (emit.js break/continue →
emitFinalizers()). Any `continue`/`break` targeting a loop nested INSIDE a
try{}finally{} wrongly executed the try's finally per-branch. In-kernel,
prepareModule's export-collection loop continues drained moduleStack (push=1
pop=2 → length -1) → every later defFunc saw moduleStack.length!==0 →
exported=false → no export attr → treeshake emptied the module → `(module)`.
Natively invisible (V8 executes prepare/index.js correctly — only jz-compiled
code manifests it). FIX (conceptual, whole shape-class): finallyStack entries
are {cleanup, depth: ctx.func.stack.length at try entry}; emitFinalizers(minDepth)
runs only entries with depth >= minDepth (non-decreasing → suffix);
break/continue pass targetFrameIndex+1, return passes 0. Labeled-break
missing-label err preserved.
HUNT METHOD (banked): BC1..BC5 marker-gated breadcrumb bisection (gate =
sentinel key in opts.modules) walked prep→emit: prepareModule clean, prepare
exit clean, sec.funcs clean, $f node MISSING export attr, defFunc stackLen=-1;
then push/pop counters proved finally-ran-twice; then GROUND TRUTH: named
kernel WAT (compile self.js graph wat:true, ~227MB) showed ~15 finalizer
inlines at continue sites inside prepareModule's try. Native repro probes all
missed it (no loop-inside-try shape) — lesson: differential-probe the exact
IR shape, or read the emitted WAT sooner.
ALSO: test/dyn-keys.js existed but was NEVER REGISTERED in test/index.js
(pins didn't run); registered. VALIDATION: statements 194 (5 new scoping
pins), kernel leg 1225, dyn-keys+parser-bugs 28, full import-syntax matrix
green in-kernel (named sq/dq, default, namespace, trailing), mod-abi
end-to-end native 5 = kernel 5, FULL BATTERY 3059/0. MODULES-ABI FRONTIER
CLOSED: the kernel compiles+runs multi-module bundles.

SSO/JSON CLUSTER — ROOT CHAIN FULLY TRACED (2026-07-23), fix in progress:
SYMPTOM: kernel-compiled JSON.parse(runtimeArg) → constant NULL ($f$exp
returns 0x7ff8000100000000; runtime __jp* family absent from output).
BC CHAIN (BC6→BC11, all differential native-vs-kernel, marker-gated via
opts.modules sentinel keys): prepared bodies identical → '()' dispatcher
identical (parsed.normal=['sf1_0']) → INSIDE emitter: typeof x='string' but
Array.isArray(x)=TRUE (contradictory!). EXPLANATION (read module/array.js:319):
Array.isArray COMPILE-TIME-FOLDS to const 1 when valTypeOf(x)===VAL.ARRAY —
when NATIVE jz compiled the kernel, the inference (param lattice) typed the
JSON.parse emit-entry closure's param x as VAL.ARRAY (unsound union over
analyzable call sites; the spread call site ctx.core.emit[callee](...normal)
in emitBuiltinCall passes arbitrary values). In-kernel then: isArr hardwired
true → x[0] via __arr_idx which RETURNS UNDEF ON TAG MISMATCH (array.js
__arr_idx tag guard) → x[0]==null true → head-coercion rewrites arg to
['str','null'] → kernel's own JSON.parse('null')... const-folds to null.
NEXT: find where the param lattice types value-escaping closure params (narrow
param lattice / paramReps; valueUsed poisoning missing?) — the FIX is to
poison lattice entries for funcs called via spread/closure-table with unknown
args, killing the whole unsound-fold class (json 9 / objects 11 / strings 2
cluster + likely speculate). The minted name is 'sf1_0' (T='',
ast.js:10 — invisible in err dumps; 8 UTF-8 bytes).
BONUS FIXES LANDED IN TREE (this wave, unpushed):
1. subscript template.js: template chunks now cook \uXXXX/\xHH/\u{...}/
   line-continuations via decodeEscape extracted+exported from string.js
   (was: esc map {n r t b f v} only — backslash dropped, 'uE000' kept as
   text). Fixed in /Users/div/projects/subscript (UNCOMMITTED — commit
   locally, NEVER push) + jz node_modules copy + kernel rebuilt with it.
   subscript suite 359 green. Probe: tmpl==lit now 1, len 8 (byte-len
   semantics by design).
2. (finding, unfixed) jz-compiled JSON.parse(undefined) returns null — must
   throw SyntaxError (ToString coercion path; test json:43 class).
PROBES: scratchpad/{sso,sso2..6,diag2,bc*,isarr*,concat2,nullish,streq,
finret*,finloop,earlyret*,spread}.mjs.

SSO/JSON LATTICE HUNT — repro status (2026-07-23): jz battery GREEN (3059/0)
with patched subscript. Minimal unsound-fold repros DON'T fire natively:
(a) dict-table closure w/ guarded x[0] reads → correct; (b) interprocedural
back-prop via helper with ARRAY call sites elsewhere → correct. The real
kernel compile's ARRAY inference for the JSON.parse emit-entry's x needs
richer context. NEXT (direct evidence, no more shape guessing): instrument
NATIVE compile of the self.js graph — in module/array.js Array.isArray
emitter, when valTypeOf(x)===VAL.ARRAY fires log the receiver name +
ctx.func.current.name (JZ_DBG env gate, host-side console.error — native
compile only, no kernel rebuild needed); compile scripts/self.js graph;
find which func/binding folds; then trace WHICH pass set that rep
(localReps/paramReps writer). Fix = kill the unsound writer for
value-escaping closures; rebuild kernel; expect json/objects/strings
cluster (9/11/2) to clear. Also queued: JSON.parse(undefined) must throw
SyntaxError (jz runtime __jp on undefined input / ToString coercion arm).

SSO/JSON CLUSTER CLEARED (2026-07-23) — landed: the reassigned-param
val-type unsoundness. analyzeBody + analyzeValTypes flow-insensitive val
trackers stamped a reassigned PARAM/captured-outer binding with its RHS
kind (`x = ['str',…]` in a branch → x:ARRAY everywhere → Array.isArray
guard const-folded to 1 → array-typed reads on a string → the OOB/undefined
class). FIX: `declared` set per walk; reassignment to an undeclared name
poisons the val slice for STANDALONE PTR KINDS ONLY — scalars (NUMBER/BOOL/
BIGINT: i32-narrowing locals/val coherence, unswitch guard) and coupled-
tracker kinds (TYPED/BUFFER: trackTyped owns coherence, mandelbrot
vectorize) keep settled behavior. SCORE: kernel json 9→2 (residual 2 =
shaped-parser-selection STRUCTURAL asserts, parity gap not value bugs),
objects 11→0, strings 2→0, spread 1→0 — KERNEL_EXCLUDE shrunk by 3.
Pin: test/inference.js 'reassigned param poisons flow-insensitive val'.
BATTERY 3060/0 (kernel leg now includes the 3 un-excluded suites).
Burn-down remaining: json shaped-parser parity 2 · statements 2 + data 1
(BigInt) · speculate 1 · preeval 2 · pow-fold 3 / fifthroot 2 (OOB) ·
async 1 (wasi-warning channel) · JSON.parse(undefined) must throw.

JSON.parse(undefined) FIXED (2026-07-23): the literal ToString fold used
loose == (undefined→'null', silently parses) instead of === (undefined→
'undefined' → SyntaxError per spec). One-token fix in module/json.js
head-coercion + spec pin in test/json.js (incl. null-still-parses).
Battery 3061/0.

STAGE-5 DUPLICATION SWEEP LANDED (2026-07-23) — the architecture plan's
LAST item. Canonical MUTATE_OPS (ast.js: ASSIGN_OPS ∪ {++,--}); deleted 7
per-file assignment-op sets, THREE of which had silently drifted:
plan/literals ASSIGN_TARGET_OPS and compile/index PARAM_REASSIGN_OPS were
missing '**=', type.js's two locals were missing '||= &&= ??='. emit's
SIDE_EFFECT_OPS now derived from MUTATE_OPS; the `ASSIGN_OPS.has(op) ||
op==='++' || op==='--'` union rewritten to MUTATE_OPS across 8 files;
type.js clonePlain → ast.js cloneNode. Left alone (semantically distinct,
refactor-not-one-line-deletion per the plan's own bar): peel-stencil
countWrites vs analyze writeCount (different decl-initializer semantics),
plan/common clonePlain (plan-local), ir.js cloneIR (no .type carry,
layering), kind-traits COMPOUND_NUMERIC_OPS (deliberately no '+='),
advise SIMD_REDUCE_OPS (reduce semantics). BATTERY 3061/0.

ARCHITECTURE PLAN: ALL STAGES COMPLETE (0-5). Perf goals: aggregate jz
1.00× leads every lane (C 1.88× / Rust 1.97× / AS 2.06× / V8 2.17×,
native C 1.11×), first-WASM per case attained. Remaining work is
LONG-TAIL kernel parity (json shaped-parser 2 · bigint 3 · speculate 1 ·
preeval 2 · pow/fifthroot 5 · async 1) and research-tier perf polish
(sdf, ulam/raymarcher examples) — tracked, none plan-gating.

CI FIX (2026-07-23): all workflows were failing at `import { resetNameUids }
from 'watr/optimize'` — the export exists only in LOCAL watr commits;
CI installs published watr. FIX: watr (local commit 00421e2, NOT pushed —
user cuts releases) attaches optimize.resetNameUids as a property of the
default export; jz reads it optionally (index.js `watOptimize.resetNameUids
?? no-op`, self.js `watOptimize.resetNameUids?.()`). Published watr → no-op
(benign: fresh-instance runs never drift; warm-reset activates on the next
watr release). Battery 3061/0.
