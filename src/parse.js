/**
 * jz's parser entry — subscript's jessie dialect with one jz-specific override.
 *
 * `NaN` parses to the self-describing `['nan']` marker rather than subscript's
 * default `[, NaN]` value-literal. A raw number-NaN (0x7FF8…) is ambiguous with
 * jz's NaN-boxed value space: as the literal flows through the self-host kernel's
 * parse/marshalling path it decodes back as a boxed value (object), so `() => NaN`
 * would miscompile to `f64.const 0`. The string-tagged marker can't be mistaken
 * for a number, survives intact, and emit() lowers it to the canonical quiet NaN
 * (see compile/emit.js `op === 'nan'`). This mirrors subscript's own reason for
 * encoding `undefined` as `[]` instead of `[, undefined]` (feature/literal.js).
 * Infinity is 0x7FF0 — outside the NaN-box space — so it survives as a plain
 * literal and needs no override.
