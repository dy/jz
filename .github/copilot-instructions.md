Parser is based on subscript/jessie.
If something is not supported by jessie, please let me know - we need to add it there first.
It should use API provided by subscript to define operators if needed.
For all features write tests with gc:false and gc:true options.
Document any deviations from standard JS behavior in research.md as appropriate.
